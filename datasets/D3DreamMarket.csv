"Building Web Applications with Visual Studio 2017 Learn how to build web applications from three Microsoft MVPs. After building the data application layer using Entity Framework Core and a RESTful service using ASP.NET Core, you will then build the client side web application three ways: first, using ASP.NET Core, then using Angular 2, and, finally, using React. You will be able to compare and contrast these UI frameworks and select the best one for your needs.<br><br>.NET Core is a complete rewrite of the popular .NET and its related frameworks. While many concepts are similar between .NET Core and the .NET 4.6 framework, there are revolutionary changes as well, including updates to Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core. The first section of this book covers the three main parts of building applications with C#: Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core Services, and ASP.NET Core Web Applications. <br><br>There is also an explosion in popularity of JavaScript frameworks for client side development, and the authors cover two of the most popular UI frameworks. Start with TypeScript for developing clean JavaScript, along with a client side build tool such as Gulp, Grunt, and WebPack. Using the same data access layer and RESTful service from the .NET Core application, you can rebuild the UI using Angular 2. Then, repeat the process using React, for a true comparison of building client side applications using ASP.NET Core, Angular 2, and React. <br><br>What You'll Learn<br><br>Understand the fundamentals of .NET Core and what that means to the traditional .NET developer<br>Build a data access layer with Entity Framework Core, a RESTful service with ASP.NET Core MVC, and a website with ASP.NET Core MVC and Bootstrap<br>Automate many build tasks with client side build utilities<br><br>Who This Book Is For<br><br>Intermediate to advanced .NET developers<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"UNIX The Textbook 3rd edition 2016 UNIX: The Textbook, Third Edition provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern, twenty-first-century UNIX operating system. The book deploys PC-BSD and Solaris, representative systems of the major branches of the UNIX family, to illustrate the key concepts. It covers many topics not covered in older, more traditional textbook approaches, such as Python, UNIX System Programming from basics to socket-based network programming using the client-server paradigm, the Zettabyte File System (ZFS), and the highly developed X Windows-based KDE and Gnome GUI desktop environments.<br><br>The third edition has been fully updated and expanded, with extensive revisions throughout. It features a new tutorial chapter on the Python programming language and its use in UNIX, as well as a complete tutorial on the git command with Github. It includes four new chapters on UNIX system programming and the UNIX API, which describe the use of the UNIX system call interface for file processing, process management, signal handling, interprocess communication (using pipes, FIFOs, and sockets), extensive coverage of internetworking with UNIX TCP/IP using the client-server software, and considerations for the design and implementation of production-quality client-server software using iterative and concurrent servers. It also includes new chapters on UNIX system administration, ZFS, and container virtualization methodologies using iocage, Solaris Jails, and VirtualBox.<br><br>Utilizing the authors almost 65 years of practical teaching experience at the college level, this textbook presents well-thought-out sequencing of old and new topics, well-developed and timely lessons, a Github site containing all of the code in the book plus exercise solutions, and homework exercises/problems synchronized with the didactic sequencing of chapters in the book. With the exception of four chapters on system programming, the book can be used very successfully by a complete novice, as well as by an experienced UNIX system user, in both an informal and formal learning environment.<br><br>The book may be used in several computer science and information technology courses, including UNIX for beginners and advanced users, shell and Python scripting, UNIX system programming, UNIX network programming, and UNIX system administration. It may also be used as a companion to the undergraduate and graduate level courses on operating system concepts and principles.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Ruby Performance Optimization Why Ruby is Slow 201 You don't have to accept slow Ruby or Rails performance. In this comprehensive guide to Ruby optimization, you'll learn how to write faster Ruby code--but that's just the beginning. See exactly what makes Ruby and Rails code slow, and how to fix it. Alex Dymo will guide you through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring, performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You'll find that all those hard things aren't so difficult after all, and your code will run orders of magnitude faster.<br><br>This is the first book ever that consolidates all the Ruby performance optimization advice in one place. It's your comprehensive guide to memory optimization, CPU optimization, garbage collector tuning, profiling, measurements, performance testing, and more.<br><br>You'll go from performance rookie to expert. First, you'll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that's easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn't trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You'll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program's execution time. And you'll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord.<br><br>As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you'll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You'll make sure slow code doesn't creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you'll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby.<br><br>And finally, you'll dive into the Ruby interpreter internals to really understand why garbage collection makes Ruby so slow, and how you can tune it up.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
"Gamification with Moodle 2015 Use game elements in Moodle courses to build learner resilience and motivation<br><br>About This Book<br><br>Formulate a Moodle course that acts as a flexible framework ready for your own content<br>Keep learners engrossed and create opportunities for motivation through the concepts of status, access, and power<br>A resourceful guide to innovative learning using automatic reports, assessments, and conditional release of activities<br><br>Who This Book Is For<br><br>This book has been designed for teachers who to use technology to create more engaging learning experiences for both online learning and in face-to-face sessions. This book will especially appeal to people who are interested in the underlying mechanics of play and games and want to know more about applying these concepts in an educational context. It is assumed that you are a teacher and expert in your field, have basic computer skills, and have access to the Internet.<br><br>What You Will Learn<br><br>Set up a scoring system using Moodle Gradebook<br>Enable communication and collaboration in your class as a Learning Community using forums<br>Assess your learners' abilities by setting up challenges and quests<br>Configure gateways to check and ensure progress before new content or activities are released<br>Create Moodle assignments to provide effective feedback through a comment bank and custom scale<br>Issue Open Badges to recognize achievements and set up an online backpack to share digital badges<br>Reduce anxiety for learners by using the game-like concept of Levelling Up<br><br>In Detail<br><br>This book describes how teachers can use Gamification design within the Moodle Learning Management System. Game elements can be included in course design by using, badges, rubrics, custom grading scales, forums, and conditional activities. Moodle courses do not have to be solo-learning experiences that replicate Distance Education models.<br><br>The Gamification design process starts by profiling players and creating levels of achievement towards meeting learning outcomes. Each task is defined, valued, and sequenced. Motivation loops are devised to keep the momentum going. In a gaming studio, this approach would require a team of specialists with a large budget and time frames. Preparing for a class rarely has these optimal conditions. The approach used in this book is to introduce game elements into the course design gradually. First, apply gamification to just one lesson and then build up to gamifying a series of lessons over a term. Each example will indicate the difficulty level and time investment. Try it out to see what is most effective with your learners and choose wisely in your use of technology.<br><br>By the end of the book, you will be able to create gripping Moodle courses for effective and efficient learning.<br><br>Style and approach<br><br>An easy-to-follow guide full of screenshots and step-by-step instructions with estimated time frames required to accomplish numerous tasks. Tips are offered for new Moodlers and plugin extensions are suggested for advanced Moodlers.

"Antidetect 7 -  Carding Browser - Anti Fingerprint _____________________________*******************_______________________________<br>_____________________________***Hi, Everyone!***_______________________________<br>_____________________________*******************_______________________________<br><br>100% VIRUS , TROJAN, MALWARE FREE!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>WHAT IS BROWSER FINGERPRINTING?<br><br>The way in which your browser is configured (especially the browser plugins used), together with details of your Operating System, allows you to be uniquely identified (and tracked) with a worryingly high degree of accuracy. <br>A particularly insidious (and ironic) aspect of this is that the more measures you take to avoid being tracked (e.g. using plugins for privacy protection), the more unique your browser fingerprint becomes.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The new predefined configurations will allow you to easily fool any website using browser fingerprinting like paypal, amazon, ebay, skrill,venmo etc.<br><br>***INTRODUCTION***<br><br>I noticed a lot of people are currently selling outdated and publicly available version of Antidetect on here. The most recent cracked version I could find on alphabay is the 6.5, which you can find on Google for free :D.<br>Obviously, those builds aren't safe to use, most of them contains malware because the seller just sell a leaked file he found somewhere on the web without further analysis not mentioning most of the features are outdated/not working/unstable.<br>So I decided to go ahead, buy a 600$ copy of the official latest AntiDetect 7.0 build and use my reverse engineering skills to crack it myself, which I successfully did !<br>The crack I'm providing to you is 100% clean, I've coded it myself from A to Z. There is no malware/spyware or any unwanted piece of software included, nothing else that the original build and my crack. Every feature has been tested working :)<br><br>The latest AntiDetect 7.0 build has been fully reworked and redesigned compared to older versions. It does not contains odd bugs, and is very friendly to use. Your success rate in frauding/carding activities will skyrocket with this new build !<br><br>***General Information***<br><br>---You can find a proof video of the software running here : http://sendvid.com/qr2wqtov<br>---Builds have been tested working on Windows 7 and 10, both x64, and under VMware. It should work properly on x86 versions as well. Older systems are not guaranteed to work.<br>---6 configs files are provided. You can use them, make your own, or buy more from the official AntiDetect config autoshop. If there is popular demand, I will resell profiles as well.<br>---You get the full original package, including original instructions on how to use the program.<br>---There's a good chance your anti-virus will freak out. This is only because of the way the program is encrypted to obfuscate its original bytecode against reverse engineering. Similar techniques are used by malwares to hide their intentions. If you don't trust me, feel free to monitor your network packets, system, anything, or run it under a clean VM only. You can check my feedbacks, everything I sell is 100% clean and legit. <br><br><br><br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, JUST ASK.<br>_____________________________________________________________<br>_____________________________________________________________ <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"How Performance Management Is Killing Performance  Rethink, Redesign, Reboot.<br><br>Most people associate performance management with the annual review, which is universally dreaded by employees, management, and HR professionals alike. It's a cookie-cutter, fear-based, top-down approach that emphasizes negatives over positives and stifles healthy career conversations. It's never been shown to motivate anyone to do anything but try to avoid it, but nobody feels like they have any alternative. Tamra Chandler has one - and it works.<br><br>Actually, Chandler doesn't offer a single alternative - she offers an infinite number of them. Each organization that uses her Performance Management Reboot is able to develop its own unique version since it doesn't make a lot of sense for organizations with different cultures, in different industries and sectors, to do things exactly the same way. Grounded in the latest scientific findings about motivation, it's a transparent, employee-driven process that values collaboration over competition and rewards people for acquiring new skills and increasing their contribution instead of hitting arbitrary benchmarks.<br><br>Chandler lays out the general principles and then walks you through each step in creating a performance management process that employees will actually embrace rather than avoid and that will help you meet the three objectives of great performance management: developing your people, rewarding them equitably, and driving your organization's performance. It's the first comprehensive, step-by-step guide to creating a performance management solution that's tailored to your organization's needs and goals and that places the emphasis squarely on your greatest asset: your people.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Lost Ancient Technology of Peru and Bolivia 2012 Peru and Bolivia have become very popular tourist destinations because, mainly, of the amazing stone remains left behind by cultures such as the Inca. Machu Picchu is the number one popular site for travelers to South America, yet how many of these visitors realize that many of the famous, and less known megalithic sites are much older than cultures such as the Inca and thus were not made by them! In this book, Brien Foerster shows you that places such as Cusco, Puma Punku, Tiwanaku and even Machu Picchu were initially constructed thousands of years before the Inca or other famous people existed. Mounting scientific evidence shows that prior to the end of the Ice Age, 12,000 years ago, very advanced cultures existed in Peru and Bolivia, and had advanced high technology.

"Opium for the Masses: Harvesting Nature's Best Pai ""Regarded as 'God's own medicine,' preparations of opium were as common in the Victorian medicine cabinet as aspirin is in ours. As late as 1915, pamphlets issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were still mentioning opium poppies as a good cash crop for northern farmers. Well into this century, Russian, Greek, and Arab immigrants in America have used poppy-head tea as a mild sedative and a remedy for headaches, muscle pain, cough, and diarrhea. During the Civil War, gardeners in the South were encouraged to plant opium for the war effort, in order to ensure a supply of painkillers for the Confederate Army. What Hogshire has done is to excavate this vernacular knowledge and then publish it to the worldin how-to form, with recipes."" Michael Pollan<br>First published fifteen years ago, Opium for the Masses instantly became a national phenomenon. Michael Pollan wrote a lengthy feature (""Opium, made easy"") about Jim Hogshire in Harpers Magazine, amazed that the common plant, P. somniferum, or opium poppies, which grows wild in many states and is available at crafts and hobby stores and nurseries, could also be made into a drinkable tea that acts in a way similar to codeine or Vicodin.<br>With Opium for the Masses as their guide, Americans can learn how to supplement their own medicine chest with natural and legal pain medicine, without costly and difficult trips to the doctor and pharmacy.<br><br>This ebook is in .pdf format <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 19.0.0 (64-Bit) + Crack Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 19.0.0 (64-Bit) + Crack<br><br><br>Adobe Illustrator CC software is the industry standard vector-drawing environment for designing across media. Express your creative vision with shapes, color, effects, and typography. Adobe Illustrator CC works with speed and stability on large, complex files, and move designs efficiently among Adobes creative applications.<br><br>Illustrator CC:<br><br>Live Shapes: Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles<br>Rectangles now have quickly modifiable corners, including independent radius control. Corner attributes are retained if you scale and rotate your rectangle. Now Illustrator remembers your work  width, height, rotation, corner treatment  so you can return to your original shape.<br><br><br>Pen tool preview<br>See the path youre drawing before you drop your next point. A rubberband-like line from your last anchor point to the tip of the pen appears as you draw. Visualize where the next curve will go as you plot your next point  and spend less time cleaning up paths.<br><br><br>Anchor point enhancements<br>Fine adjustment of curves is now easier. New anchor point controls allow unequal or different-direction handles to be dragged as you draw to control the smoothness of each segment. You can even change a corner point to smooth without ruining your shape.<br><br><br>Snap to pixel, point, and grid updates<br>When snapping is turned on, your anchor points align perfectly to your choice of pixel, grid, or point. But your anchor handles should not. Theyre now disengaged from snapping so you can preserve the precision of your curves and achieve fine control while editing.<br><br><br>Close paths with better control<br>Close your paths with precision and predictability. As you complete a drawing, you now have more control connecting the end and start points. Reposition your closing point or choose to break the direction lines to adjust the closing curve exactly as you wish.<br><br><br>Windows GPU acceleration<br>New GPU acceleration for Windows lets you work faster on Windows 7 or 8 computers. This feature requires an Adobe-certified NVIDIA graphics card with at least 1GB of VRAM.<br><br><br>Typekit missing fonts workflow<br>When you open a document, missing fonts are now automatically replaced. Illustrator CC searches the Typekit desktop font library and if the missing font is available it will sync through Creative Cloud with just a click.<br><br><br>And so much more<br>Also includes: Improvements to the Missing Fonts dialog and enhancements to text-related layout and typing features<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Against the State An Anarcho Capitalist Manifesto  Against the State: An Anarcho-Capitalist Manifesto diagnoses what is wrong with the American political system and tells us what we need to fix things. The cure is a radical one because, as the book incontrovertibly shows, the many problems that confront us today are no accident. They stem from the nature of government itself. Only peaceful cooperation based on the free market can rescue us from our present plight.<br><br>Against the State is written by Lew Rockwell, the founder of the Mises Institute and LewRockwell.com, and the closest friend and associate of Murray Rothbard, the leading theorist of anarcho-capitalism. Rockwell applies Rothbards combination of individualist anarchism and Austrian economics to contemporary America. The book shows how the government is based on war, both against foreign nations and against the American people themselves, through massive invasions of our liberties. Fueled by an out-of-control banking system, the American State has become in essence fascist. We cannot escape our predicament through limited government: the government is incapable of controlling itself. Only a purely private social order can save us, and Rockwell succinctly sets out how an anarcho-capitalist order would work.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Tactical Barbell Definitive Strength Training 3rd  Operational athletes are a unique breed. You need to physically perform at an extraordinarily high level in stressful situations. Often in dangerous or unstable environments. As a SWAT operator, combat-arms soldier, or first responder, you have to be a Jack of All Trades. Lets take that a step further. You have to achieve some degree of mastery. You have to be strong, have incredible levels of endurance, and be capable of sustained bursts of intense activity. All while tired, hungry, cold, or worse. You cant train like a bodybuilder. You can't be sore for a week after 'leg' day. You cant afford to specialize like a powerlifter. You have other abilities you need to develop, things like cardiovascular training, work capacity, and occupational skills. Anyone thats operational knows its a constant juggling act trying to become (and stay) superhuman. Tactical Barbell is a strength training program designed specifically for operational athletes using correct principles and best practices. The objective being to increase maximal-strength and strength-endurance, while taking into account the need to simultaneously train other fitness domains. Periodization based, with a simple progression model that allows for a great degree of customization. You wont find cables, balance boards or medicine balls in this program. What you will get is a reliable, repeatable, cutting edge system to increase your strength dramatically. In a manner that leaves you time and energy to train all those other things you need to be good at. No fluff. No frills. If you live in the arena, you know talk is cheap. The program includes a built in strength testing component. You will know whether or not your strength has increased, and by how much. Simple.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Murach's jQuery 2nd edition 2015 Today, jQuery is used in over 60% of the million most-visited websites, and that makes it one of the technologies that every web developer should master. The problem is that jQuery is difficult to learn, especially for those with limited programming experience. But now, this new edition of our jQuery book makes it easier than ever to learn how to use jQuery to create the dynamic user interfaces, fast response times, and special effects that today's users expect.<br><br>In brief, sections 2 and 3 of this book present the essential jQuery and jQuery UI (User Interface) skills for developing professional jQuery applications. With those skills, you ll be able to add all of the popular jQuery features to your web pages: image swaps, image rollovers, slide shows, accordions, tabs, carousels, and much more.<br><br>Then, section 4 shows you how to use Ajax and JSON to get data from a web server and add it to a web page without reloading the page. It also shows how to use Ajax and JSON with the APIs for websites like Flickr and Google Maps and with HTML5 APIs like Geolocation, Web Storage, and Web Workers.<br><br>What about section 1? It provides a four-chapter crash course in the JavaScript skills that you need to use jQuery. That means you don't need to know JavaScript before you start using this book, and that makes this the right book for programmers who aren't familiar with JavaScript, as well as for programming novices. This section also becomes the ideal reference for the JavaScript that's used for the jQuery applications in this book...or for any jQuery application.<br><br>The last section of this book shows you how to use jQuery Mobile to develop mobile websites. This requires little or no programming, and it's a great alternative when it's impractical to rebuild an established website with Responsive Web Design.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"95 Ways to Use Humor ""We may not all be born comedians, but most people are naturally humorous, says Doni Tamblyn, a comic-turned-trainer whose humorous techniques bring serious results at clients such as Chevron, Wells Fargo, and other Fortune 500 companies, universities, and government entities. While Laugh and Learn offers plenty to keep smiles on the faces of trainers and their students, it's not a collection of one-liners and knock-knock jokes. It's an enlightening and practical look at how teachers and training professionals can inject elements of entertainment, creativity, humor, and emotion into their existing methods, even when dealing with serious or technical topics. Filled with fun, challenging, and thought-provoking exercises to help readers feel more comfortable being funny, the book also provides dozens of workshop activities and techniques to introduce humor into the learning environment. Combining the latest brain studies and humor research with the author's own 23 years of experience in comedy and corporate training, Laugh and Learn is a fascinating look at what makes learners perk up, pay attention -- and remember!""

"Cryptography Made Simple 2016 In this introductory textbook the author explains the key topics in cryptography. He takes a modern approach, where defining what is meant by secure is as important as creating something that achieves that goal, and security definitions are central to the discussion throughout.<br><br>The chapters in Part 1 offer a brief introduction to the mathematical foundations: modular arithmetic, groups, finite fields, and probability; primality testing and factoring; discrete logarithms; elliptic curves; and lattices. Part 2 of the book shows how historical ciphers were broken, thus motivating the design of modern cryptosystems since the 1960s; this part also includes a chapter on information-theoretic security. Part 3 covers the core aspects of modern cryptography: the definition of security; modern stream ciphers; block ciphers and modes of operation; hash functions, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions; the naive RSA algorithm; public key encryption and signature algorithms; cryptography based on computational complexity; and certificates, key transport and key agreement. Finally, Part 4 addresses advanced prot ocols, where the parties may have different or even conflicting security goals: secret sharing schemes; commitments and oblivious transfer; zero-knowledge proofs; and secure multi-party computation.<br><br>The author balances a largely non-rigorous style - many proofs are sketched only - with appropriate formality and depth. For example, he uses the terminology of groups and finite fields so that the reader can understand both the latest academic research and real-world documents such as application programming interface descriptions and cryptographic standards. The text employs colour to distinguish between public and private information, and all chapters include summaries and suggestions for further reading.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Genesis 6 Conspiracy How Secret Societies 2014 There are giants among us, passing largely unnoticed, intent on carrying out a secret plan to enslave all humanity. They may not look like giants today, but their bloodlines extend all the way back to the Nephilim-the offspring of angels who mated with human women-described in Genesis 6 when giants roamed the land. Gary Wayne, author of The Genesis 6 Conspiracy: How Secret Societies and the Descendants of Giants Plan to Enslave Humankind, details the role of modern-day Nephilim in Satan's plan to install the Antichrist at the End of Days. When God cast the angel Lucifer and his followers out of heaven, Lucifer set into motion a scheme to ensure the Nephilim survived. Why? Because from the bloodlines of these Nephilim the Antichrist will come. To keep his plan alive, Satan has enlisted the loyalty of secret societies such as the Freemasons, the Templars, and the Rosicrucians to conspire in teaching a theology and a history of the world that is contrary to the biblical one. This Genesis 6 Conspiracy marches toward the Great Tribulation, when the loyalty of the Terminal Generation-this generation-will be tested. The Bible, along with many other ancient sources, clearly records the existence of giants. Wayne provides copious citations from many society insiders, along with extensive Bible references, other religious references, and historical material to bolster his contention. What he uncovers will astonish you-and it will challenge you to prepare for the fulfilling of God's promises.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Since first mentioned in October 2010 there were: two full versions (v1 and v2), Mini-Java version, Java edition, Adobe edition and the latest - Bleeding Life RELOADED seen ""in-the-wild"". As with other exploit kits, this one uses PHP and MySQL backend; it also utilizes AJAX technology to refresh statistics in real time, allowing the owner of this kit to be aware of situations in real time.<br><br>This kit can be modified by editing configuration files to control such things as: <br>-Time between exploitation attempts<br>-Use of AJAX for overall statistics and refresh time <br>-Reuse of iframe (either each exploit is going to be created in its own iframe or use the same iframe), and name of the malicious payload file. <br><br>The author of this product claims ""it is intended solely for the purposes of vulnerability and penetration testing"" but encrypts it with commercial PHP encryption and sells it on black market forums. The Bleeding Life exploit kit uses exploits which can bypass ASLR and DEP, which means this product could be used successfully against Windows 7 and Windows Vista operating systems but not limited to those systems.<br><br>Lets fuck. <br>","D3DreamMarket","YES"

"Gladiators Pirates and Games of Trust 2017 A bestselling Israeli author offers a delightful take on decision making for non-experts and non-mathematicians. Written in simple language, the book is essential reading for business professionals and anyone interested in cognitive psychology and economics.<br><br>Shapira provides humorous anecdotes and insightful examples of how our daily lives are affected by Game Theory. Game Theory is the mathematical formalization of interactive decision-making  it assumes that each player's goal is to maximize his/her benefit, whatever it may be. Players may be friends, foe, political parties, states, or anyone that behaves interactively, whether as a group or as an individual. One of the problems with game analysis is the fact that, as a player, its very hard to know what would benefit each of the other players, some of us are not even clear about our own goals or what indeed might actually benefit us. Haim Shapira uses multiple examples to explain what Game Theory is and how the different interactions between decision makers can play out.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"C# for Beginners The Tactical Guidebook 2013 This book is for YOU if you are a prospective C# programmer and like a CHALLENGE. This is not your run of the mill encyclopedic programming book; it is highly modularized, tactical and practical, meaning that you learn by reading theory and then implement targeted exercises.<br><br>One big difference from most of the other programming books out there, other than being highly modularized and tactical, is that you actually will implement graphical user interfaces in the form of Windows Forms (with a few exceptions) instead of boring text based Console applications. You will also create many small complete applications instead of one gigantic and overwhelming application or small examples taken out of context. Towards the end of the first part of the book when you have learned the basics of the C# language and object-oriented programming (OOP) you will implement a larger application from start to finish.<br><br>The book does not presuppose that you have any prior C# knowledge since the purpose of the book is to teach you just that. Even if you already have created a couple of small C# projects on your own or have been developing applications for a while you might find the content in this book useful as a refresher.<br><br>The first part describes the fundamentals of the C# language such as variables, loops and methods. The book then gets progressively more challenging, describing, among other things, object oriented programming, generics, multithreading, asynchronous operations and reflection. The content is tactical, practical and highly modular to make it easier for you to learn. This mean that you actually have to read and implement the exercises in order to learn everything the book teaches. It is not recommended that you only read the book conceptually from cover to cover; the best way to learn is to be tactical and actually implement the practical exercises after reading each chapter.<br><br>If you are aspiring to take the Microsoft exam 70-483 this book can be a great complement to the more traditional encyclopedic books on the market in that it contains many complete examples and exercises that you can implement to deepen your understanding of C#. The author has worked professionally with C# since it was released and as a Microsoft Certified Instructor for a number of years teaching C#, Visual Basic.NET and the .NET Framework.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"How to Build Shelters and Safe Rooms Collection (1 How to Build Shelters and Safe Rooms Collection<br><br><br>11 eBooks<br>Language: English<br>Format:  Pdf  <br><br>These manuals are intended to provide guidance for property owners to design shelters and safe rooms. It presents information about the design and construction of shelters outside, in the work place, home, or community building that will provide protection in response to manbmade hazards. Because the security needs and types of construction vary greatly, users may select the methods and measures that best meet their individual situations.<br>The information contained herein will assist in the planning and design of shelters that may be constructed outside or within dwellings or public buildings. These safe rooms will protect occupants from a variety of hazards, including debris impact, accidental or intentional explosive detonation, and the accidental or intentional release of a toxic substance into the air. Safe rooms may also be designed to protect individuals from assaults and attempted kidnapping, which requires design features to resist forced entry and ballistic impact. This covers a range of protective options, from low-cost expedient protection (what is commonly referred to as sheltering-in-place) to safe rooms ventilated and pressurized with air purified by ultra-high-efficiency filters.

"BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE Of the many strange books I have published this must be one of the strangest.<br>For a start, publication has been held back 20 years, even though I paid the author all that time ago.<br>This work is so dark, potent and lethal, containing arcane rites which have never been in print and<br>surely will never be again. In fact the author writes that he gives the information under pain of death.<br>Realizing that I still hadnt published it he urged me to delay until he had passed on, which is what has<br>happened.<br>My original procrastination was due to my feelings about the content: I simply felt it was too taboo<br>even for the occult market. I toyed with the idea of merely printing 20 copies selling at 100 a copy to<br>the most serious practitioners of the dark arts.<br>But here it is now in the catalogue, for all to see, or at least for everyone to be aware of. I will not even<br>hint at suggesting that the average occultist should try it. No, this is not a book for everyone, but for the<br>very few.<br>I can see why he was under pain of death to reveal these secrets, and whoever may seek to use them<br>will certainly not want to share with others!<br>At least there are no human and animal sacrifices here; but otherwise this volume travels through some<br>very dark territory indeed.<br>This book is strictly for the daring and darkly adventurous. It is a book of pacts and ceremonies,<br>promising GREAT WEALTH  POWER  PRESTIGE  destruction of enemies.<br>The only modification I have made to it is the deletion of the authors case histories, for in spite of the<br>changed names and locations the individuals concerned could still be identified, for they all became<br>famous.<br>The author ran his own coven for many years, his followers benefiting greatly from his knowledge. In<br>his brand of dark magick he says, No belief is required, not even faith<br>. Follow the instructions: The ceremonies work first time and every time. They always have, they<br>always will. This book, he says, can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.<br>Whoever starts on this pathway stays forever, beyond death and eternity, he says.<br>Keep your promises to the gods invoked  which seem small compared to the rewards  and you will<br>be protected. But this is not kids play.<br>Contents include: Thoughtforms  Supermind  Lucifer  Passing Exams  Causing Chaos  The<br>Snake GodBeelzebub  Infernal Necromancy  The Lurk  The Ultimate Black Mass.<br>I am perhaps the only publisher who would publish this Black Magic Book.

"The Micro Economy Today 14th edition 2015 The Economy Today is noted for three great strengths: readability, policy orientation, and pedagogy. The accessible writing style engages students and brings some of the excitement of domestic and global economic news into the classroom. Schiller emphasizes how policymakers must choose between government intervention and market reliance to resolve the core issues of what, how, and for whom to produce. This strategic choice is highlighted throughout the full range of micro, macro, and international issues, and every chapter ends with a policy issue that emphasizes the markets vs. government dilemma. The authors teach economics in a relevant context, filling chapters with the real facts and applications of economic life. Schiller is also the only principles text that presents all macro theory in the single consistent context of the AS/AD framework.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

It affects basically all aspects of modern life and is co-evolving with the progress of technology. Governments and law enforcement have a distinct difficulty to adjust to this new culture, which is being developed mostly by hackers. Hackers play a central role in cyber security. They are the drivers of change. Cyber security is an inherent part of the world of computers, of Information and Communication Technology and of the life on the Internet.

"The Einstein Hoax The Einstein Hoax: The Disastrous Intellectual War on Common Sense<br><br>Much of this book was written a long time ago when the author first became aware of the concepts of Special and General relativity. At the time he assumed that the subject was well thought out and understood by people more knowledgeable and probably more intelligent than himself. His goal was to learn from them and to understand the phenomena being described. He could not, however, accept the prevalent idea that the workings of Nature were beyond the ability of mere mortals to understand at the 'common sense' level. As he studied the subject, he learned that this dictum was an intellectual 'con game' by men who were acting in the manner of a priesthood defending the 'true faith' rather than scientists. The dictum is not true; the mechanisms by which Nature operates are, for the most part, easily understood and the necessary mathematics and arguments to evaluate their validity are within the knowledge of sophomore students in engineering or physical. It is the purpose of this book to make these mechanisms understandable to the general reader. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Art of Fear Why Conquering Fear Wont Work 2017 A revolutionary guide to acknowledging fear and developing the tools we need to build a healthy relationship with this confusing emotion - and use it as a positive force in our lives.<br><br>We all feel fear. Yet we are often taught to ignore it, overcome it, push past it. But to what benefit? This is the essential question that guides Kristen Ulmers remarkable exploration of our most misunderstood emotion in The Art of Fear.<br><br>Once recognized as the best extreme skier in the world (an honor she held for twelve years), Ulmer knows fear well. In this conversation-changing book, she argues that fear is not here to cause us problems - and that in fact, the only true issue we face with fear is our misguided reaction to it (not the fear itself).<br><br>Rebuilding our experience with fear from the ground up, Ulmer starts by exploring why weve come to view it as a negative. From here, she unpacks fear and shows it to be just one of 10,000 voices that make up our reality, here to help us come alive alongside joy, love, and gratitude. Introducing a mindfulness tool called Shift, Ulmer teaches readers how to experience fear in a simpler, more authentic way, transforming our relationship with this emotion from that of a draining battle into one thats in line with our true nature.<br><br>Influenced by Ulmers own complicated relationship with fear and her over 15 years as a mindset facilitator, The Art of Fear will reconstruct the way we react to and experience fear - empowering us to easily and permanently address the underlying cause of our fear-based problems, and setting us on course to live a happier, more expansive future.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

A single click of the Open button will open the hidden file or folder, so that it becomes visible to you. You can then edit or modify it as if it has been unhidden. When you have completed editing, you just close the program and the file or folder will become hidden again automatically. This useful feature comes in handy when you edit frequently used hidden files. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Blitzed Drugs in the 3rd Reich The Nazi regime preached an ideology of physical, mental, and moral purity. But as Norman Ohler reveals in this gripping new history, the Third Reich was saturated with drugs. On the eve of World War II, Germany was a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and companies such as Merck and Bayer cooked up cocaine, opiates, and, most of all, methamphetamines, to be consumed by everyone from factory workers to housewives to millions of German soldiers. In fact, troops regularly took rations of a form of crystal meththe elevated energy and feelings of invincibility associated with the high even help to explain certain German military victories.<br><br>Drugs seeped all the way up to the Nazi high command and, especially, to Hitler himself. Over the course of the war, Hitler became increasingly dependent on injections of a cocktail of drugsincluding a form of heroinadministered by his personal doctor. While drugs alone cannot explain the Nazis toxic racial theories or the events of World War II, Ohlers investigation makes an overwhelming case that, if drugs are not taken into account, our understanding of the Third Reich is fundamentally incomplete.<br><br>Carefully researched and rivetingly readable, Blitzed throws surprising light on a history that, until now, has remained in the shadows. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Chomsky Language Mind and Politics 2nd edition 201 Noam Chomsky has made major contributions to three fields: political history and analysis, linguistics, and the philosophies of mind, language, and human nature. In this thoroughly revised and updated volume, James McGilvray provides a critical introduction to Chomsky's work in these three key areas and assesses their continuing importance and relevance for today.<br><br>In an incisive and comprehensive analysis, McGilvray argues that Chomskys work can be seen as a unified intellectual project. He shows how Chomsky adapts the tools of natural science to the study of mind and of language in particular and explains why Chomsky's rationalist approach to the mind continues to be opposed by the majority of contemporary cognitive scientists. The book also discusses some of Chomskys central political themes in depth, examining how Chomsky's view of the good life and the ideal form of social organization is related to and in part dependent on his biologically based account of human nature and the place of language within it. As in the first edition, McGilvray emphasizes the distinction between common sense and science and the difference between rationalist and empiricist approaches to the mind, making clear the importance of these themes for understanding Chomsky's work and showing that they are based on elementary observations that are accessible to everyone. This edition has been extensively re-written to emphasize Chomsky's recent work, which increasingly 'biologizes' the study of language and mind and - by implication - the study of human nature.<br><br>This book will be of interest to students and scholars of philosophy, linguistics, and politics, as well as to all those keen to develop a critical understanding of one of the most controversial and important thinkers writing today.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Android apps can appear either as icons on the Windows desktop, or within a full-blown Android environment. BlueStacks helps PC manufacturers to ride the Android momentum by enabling Android apps on x86-based tablets, netbooks, notebooks, convertibles and AiO Windows PCs.<br><br>With the new hybrid convertible form factors, BlueStacks completely eliminates the need to carry two devices. The end consumer benefits from getting both Android and Windows at the price of a single PC.<br><br>The seamless user experience, simultaneous use of Android and Windows apps, and multi-touch enablement are built on ground breaking virtualization technology which requires zero configuration and is transparent to the end consumer.<br><br>Once installed and launched, this application displays 10 pre-loaded applications, with a dedicated option to allow its users download new ones from the Internet. There is no separate configuration screen, but only a few options, so you shouldn't spend too much time setting up the program.<br><br>BlueStacks can run the Android apps in full-screen, with very fast loading times and with absolutely no errors. Most of the games can be controlled by mouse, just like you'd do on your typical touschscreen mobile phone.<br><br>Another feature that's worth mentioning is the so-called BlueStacks Cloud Connect, a separate tool designed to allow users push their applications from the Android device to the PC and thus access them on the computer.<br><br>The software integrates seamlessly with Citrix and Microsoft software delivery infrastructure and with Citrix's Enterprise App Store. With BlueStacks, enterprise IT can deliver Android apps securely and effortlessly to any end point running Windows.<br><br>This app runs on low resources and works just fine on Windows 10, but there are some minor compatibility issues on older systems, which means it may fail to load on Windows XP and Vista.<br><br>Bluestacks v2.3.29.6222 <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
"Kali Linux Revealed Mastering the Penetration Test Kali Linux has not only become the information security professional's platform of choice, but evolved into an industrial-grade, and world-class operating system distribution--mature, secure, and enterprise-ready.<br><br>Through the decade-long development process, Muts and his team, along with countless volunteers from the hacker community, have taken on the burden of streamlining and organizing our work environment, freeing us from much of the drudgery. They provided a secure and reliable foundation, allowing us to concentrate on securing our digital world.<br><br>An amazing community has built up around Kali Linux. Every month, more than 300,000 of us download a version of Kali. We come together in online and real-world training rooms and grind through the sprawling Offensive Security Penetration Testing Labs, pursuing the near-legendary Offensive Security certifications. We come together on the Kali forums, some 40,000 strong, and hundreds of us at a time can be found on the Kali IRC channel. We gather at conferences and attend Kali Dojos to learn from the developers themselves how to best leverage Kali.<br><br>However, the Kali team has never released an official Kali Linux manual, until now.<br><br>In this book, we'll focus on the Kali Linux platform itself, and help you understand and maximize Kali from the ground up. The developers will walk you through Kali Linux features and fundamentals, provide a crash course in basic Linux commands and concepts, and then walk you through the most common Kali Linux installation scenarios. You'll learn how to configure, troubleshoot and secure Kali Linux and then dive into the powerful Debian package manager. Throughout this expansive section, you'll learn how to install and configure packages, how to update and upgrade your Kali installation, and how to create your own custom packages. Then you'll learn how to deploy your custom installation across massive enterprise networks. Finally, you'll be guided through advanced topics such as kernel compilation, custom ISO creation, industrial-strength encryption, and even how to install crypto kill switches to safeguard your sensitive information.<br><br>Whether you're a veteran or an absolute n00b, this is the best place to start with Kali Linux, the security professional's platform of choice.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","Undecided"

As an undergraduate textbook in introductory biophysics, it includes the necessary background and tools, including exercises and appendices, to form a progressive course. In this case, the chapters can be used in the order proposed, possibly split between two semesters.<br><br>The book is also an absorbing read for researchers in the life sciences who wish to refresh or go deeper into the physics concepts gleaned in their early years of scientific training. Less physics-oriented readers might want to skip the first chapter, as well as all the ""gray boxes"" containing the more formal developments, and create their own -la-carte menu of chapters. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Cybernetics Warfare and Discourse 2017 This book critiques mainstream beliefs about cyberwarfare and forges a new path in the way of defining this largely misunderstood concept. Rather than outlining cyberspace as a new technology applied in military operations, here, Tsirigotis rallies against this technocentric account and establishes how cyberspace, first and foremost, should be categorized as a new way to understand war and military power in the Information Age. Using genre analysis and Corpus Linguistics, the author scrutinizes how cyberspace has changed the way the UK comprehends war and military power, and how the cybernetisation of war has manifested itself in Britain's approach to national defense and security.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Instant Revit Commercial Drawing Using Autodesk Re Instant Revit!: Commercial Drawing Using Autodesk Revit 2018<br><br>This book is for students that have some experience using Autodesk Revit. This book contains step-by-step project tutorials with screenshots using the Revit program. The units for the projects are in Imperial (Feet & Inches) units. The book consists of the drawing of a two-story commercial building.<br><br>A three-dimensional model of the project will be developed and used to create views of the: floor plan, longitudinal section, interior and exterior elevations, wall sections, detail views of the structure, and renderings of the interior and exterior of the structure. Some of these drawings will be annotated with dimensions and notes. Door, window, and room finish schedules will be also be created. Once these drawings are completed, the student will then create design options of the structure. This allows the design to be presented with multiple styles or options within the same file.<br><br>There is also a companion website for the book that is maintained by the author. Purchasers of the book will be able to view demonstration videos of the tutorials and download files that are used for the project.<br><br>Revit families are presented as part of the project. Families are groups of elements that may be added to the project such as: furniture, cabinetry, fixtures, lighting, HVAC components, people, vehicles, elevators, etc The student will utilize these files to add various elements to their project. Family files are also provided from manufacturers sites and the companion website.<br><br>Students will then be guided through the process of creating perspective views and renderings of the project. Instruction includes use of the Autodesk 360 site to process renderings within a cloud. Cloud rendering utilizes an Autodesk server for processing instead of the student's own computer. This allows for renderings to be created at a much faster rate. After the project is completed, additional information about the creation and use of stacked walls and keynotes is presented.<br><br>Emphasis is placed on making the learning process as quick and as easy as possible with a minimum of extra information. This way the student may concentrate on completing the project and becoming a productive Revit drafter and designer in a relatively short time.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Marcus Raskin - The Four Freedoms Under Siege - Th Marcus Raskin - The Four Freedoms Under Siege - The Clear and Present Danger from Our<br><br>FDRs Four FreedomsFreedom of Speech, Freedom to Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fearwere presented to the American people in his 1941 State of the Union address, and they became the inspiration for a second bill of rights, extending the New Deal and guaranteeing work, housing, medical care, and education. Although the bill never was adopted in a legal sense in this country, its principles pervaded the political landscape for an entire generation, including the War on Poverty and the Great Society reforms of the 1960s.<br><br>The ideas expressed in the Four Freedoms speech inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But since the late 1970s and early 1980s, these freedoms have been under assault, from administrations of both parties, economic pressures, and finally, the alleged requirements of national security. After 9/11, this process accelerated even more rapidly. The authors address the hard questions of individual freedom versus national security that are on the minds of Americans of all political stripes. They bring together the pivotal events, leaders, policies, and fateful decisionsoften pathbreaking, more often ending in follythat have subverted our constitutional government from its founding.<br><br>You reach the inescapable conclusion, the authors write, that the United States is a warrior nation, has been addicted to war from the start, and is able to sustain its warfare habit only by mugging American taxpayers, and believing in its mission as Gods chosen.

"Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide: A Handb Digital download sent via PM<br><br>In the 1970s two of the most influential thinkers of the psychedelic era gathered what was then known about psilocybin botany and culture and presented it in Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide. Writing under pseudonyms, the McKenna brothers provided simple, reliable, and productive methods for magic mushroom propagation, including black-and-white photographs that showed the techniques of the time. The development of more modern cultivation techniques does not eclipse the cultural contributions of this book. Philosophical asides, whimsical illustrations evoking the mystical nature of mushrooms, and speculations about the relationship of these organisms to humankind provide a lasting legacy. Truly the classic manual on home cultivation, the wisdom of Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide continues to inspire new students of psycho-mycologyand refreshes psychedelic memories for others.  <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

It's a site that we haven't re-viewed before, and judging by the tour there are a lot of sexy men here, so let's head inside and take a look.<br>The site promises that the first few updates will focus on Eve's temptation of men. That makes it sound like there are women inside, but there aren't - just a crew of very hot men. The first video features a naked man standing in a garden with a boa constrictor wrapped around him, and later in another video, he's walking alone in the garden. Beyond that, the theme of Eve and her conquest of men flies right over my head. I'm sure it makes sense to the artist, but he's very likely alone in his illumination. Still, his videos are sexy, provocative, sensual and alluring.<br>The Temptation of Eve features a collection of sexy studs and well-built men in their twenties. They have athletic bodies with rock-hard abs and asses, and quite a few are muscle hunks with gorgeous physiques, although none looks like he spends too much time in the gym. The guys are good looking to handsome, and while most get naked in their videos, they don't always show their cocks.

"CODING FREEDOM THE ETHICS AND AESTHETICS OF HACKIN Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking By E. Gabriella Coleman <br>2012 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 0691144613 , 0691144605 | EPUB | 2 MB <br><br><br>Who are computer hackers? What is free software? And what does the emergence of a community dedicated to the production of free and open source software--and to hacking as a technical, aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS) movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes that guide its production, and the political struggles through which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property. <br><br>E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration. <br><br>Just extract the rar archive and enjoy it... <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Resistive Random Access Memory RRAM 2016 RRAM technology has made significant progress in the past decade as a competitive candidate for the next generation non-volatile memory (NVM). This lecture is a comprehensive tutorial of metal oxide-based RRAM technology from device fabrication to array architecture design. State-of-the-art RRAM device performances, characterization, and modeling techniques are summarized, and the design considerations of the RRAM integration to large-scale array with peripheral circuits are discussed. Chapter 2 introduces the RRAM device fabrication techniques and methods to eliminate the forming process, and will show its scalability down to sub-10 nm regime. Then the device performances such as programming speed, variability control, and multi-level operation are presented, and finally the reliability issues such as cycling endurance and data retention are discussed. Chapter 3 discusses the RRAM physical mechanism, and the materials characterization techniques to observe the conductive filaments and the electrical characterization techniques to study the electronic conduction processes. It also presents the numerical device modeling techniques for simulating the evolution of the conductive filaments as well as the compact device modeling techniques for circuit-level design. Chapter 4 discusses the two common RRAM array architectures for large-scale integration: one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) and cross-point architecture with selector. The write/read schemes are presented and the peripheral circuitry design considerations are discussed. Finally, a 3D integration approach is introduced for building ultra-high density RRAM array. Chapter 5 is a brief summary and will give an outlook for RRAM's potential novel applications beyond the NVM applications.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
"M S King - The War Against Putin - What the Govern M S King - The War Against Putin - What the Government-Media Complex Isnt<br><br><br>M. S. King - The War Against Putin - What the Government-Media Complex Isnt Telling You About Russia - epub [TKRG]<br><br>In the West, politicians and journalists of all stripes have referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""thug"", a ""tyrant"", a ""murderer"", a ""Communist"", a ""Nazi"", the next ""Hitler"" and more. But amongst the Russian people, his popularity rating has reached levels as high as 85%. There is even a very popular hit 'disco' song about him - 'A Man Like Putin'. So, who's right? Why such hatred for Vladimir Putin? Is it justified? Or has Putin been targeted merely for standing up the US-EU Axis of Internationalism? In clear, simple, powerful and concise language - supported by more than 100 illustrations - 'The War Against Putin' takes readers on an exciting 'crash course' journey from Russia's Medieval founding, through the days of the Czars, through the Communist Revolution and bloody Civil War, through Stalin & World War II, through the Cold War, through the Soviet collapse, through the Yeltsin disaster, and finally the Putin-led rebirth of the Russian nation. It is one of the ""greatest stories never told"", and will shed badly needed light on the new Russia, its dynamic leader, the dark forces aiming to bring about its demise, and maybe even World War III. Says Dr. William Carlucci: ""I was glued to the edge of my seat with jaw wide open as I read this gem of a book from start to finish, in a single sitting. The clarity and simplicity with which King's masterpiece demystifies current events represents a rare ability to speak to the reader with entertaining and understandable prose.

It is thought to have infected over 1.4 million machines in its two years of operation, netting its shadowy users millions in the process.<br>According to the charges, Panin sold custom versions of SpyEye on invitation-only black code forums for between $1,000 to $8,500 a pop, and he had at least 150 clients. Just one of these, going by the moniker ""Soldier,"" made a reported $3.2m from financial fraud using the malware. As of 2013, over 10,000 bank accounts are thought to have been compromised by it.<br>In February 2011, law enforcement seized a SpyEye server in a data center in Georgia and federal investigators found contact details for Panin embedded in the code. They then bought a copy of SpyEye from him and used it to file charges, before arresting him while he was en route through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.<br>The investigation has also led to the arrest of four of Panin's ""clients and associates"" in the UK and Bulgaria.<br>""Panin was the architect of a pernicious malware known as 'SpyEye' that infected computers worldwide,"" said US Attorney Sally Yates of the Northern District of Georgia. ""He commercialized the wholesale theft of financial and personal information. And now he is being held to account for his actions. Cyber criminals be forewarned: you cannot hide in the shadows of the Internet.

In more than one hundred thirty striking images, ""The Exultant Ark"" celebrates the full range of animal experience with dramatic portraits of animal pleasure ranging from the charismatic and familiar to the obscure and bizarre. These photographs, windows onto the inner lives of pleasure seekers, show two polar bears engaged in a bout of wrestling, hoary marmots taking time for a friendly chase, Japanese macaques enjoying a soak in a hot spring, a young bull elk sticking out his tongue to catch snowflakes, and many other rewarding moments. Biologist and best-selling author Jonathan Balcombe is our guide, interpreting the images within the scientific context of what is known about animal behavior. In the end, old attitudes fall away as we gain a heightened sense of animal individuality and of the pleasures that make life worth living for all sentient beings.<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Understanding the need to test your wireless systems. Wireless vulnerabilities. Thinking like a hacker. Introduction To Kali and WiFi Pen Testing.<br>Kali Linux is the evolution of Backtrack a notorious Digital Forensic and Intrusion Detection software suite with a whole lot of tools for Penetration Testing. Offensive Security, the creators of Backtrack and Kali Linux, decided to incorporate many new changes to what was then to be called Backtrack 6. Since it had been completely built from scratch up and many new changes added it was given a new name, Kali Linux.<br><br>If you have by chance seen or used Backtrack before the commands are the same but there are some differences. For example Kali Linux is based on Debian instead of Ubuntu, also there is no longer a /pentest directory as in Backtrack 5.<br><br>Prior knowledge is not needed with this tutorial series as it is setup for the beginner or someone new to wireless penetration testing. Basically if you have never used Backtrack or Kali Linux before all you really need to know is that Kali Linux is the best software to use for Digital Forensics, Intrusion Detection, and Penetration Testing.<br><br>Kali Linux is the operating system being used, but as for the commands and cracks a software suite bundled into Kali Linux is what will be used called Aircrack-ng. This is a software bundle that was specifically designed and coded to exploit wireless vulnerabilities.<br><br>Three hacks will be the main focus in this series, WPA dictionary attack, WPA Reaver attack, and WEP.<br><br>Talking about WEP encryption on routers has become dated but it is still seen sometimes and is a good way to learn the basics for someone new to penetration testing. After learning WEP the more difficult cracks such as Reaver and dictionary attacks will be easier to understand.<br><br>Also there is no point and click options. Learning commands and typing them in a terminal window is a must, but the commands are easy to learn or written down.<br><br>One thing to mention also is that a internal wireless network adapter will not work with Kali Linux and wireless penetration testing. This is not because the adapter is not supported it may or may not be. It is because most wireless chipsets do not support packet injections or the things required to do a wireless attack. <br>","D3DreamMarket","YES"

By way of background, a family office is a company, or group of people, who manage the wealth a family has gained over generations. The term ?family office? has an element of cachet, and even mystique, because it is usually associated with the megawealthy. However, practically speaking, virtually any family that manages its investments independent of the size of the investment pool could be considered a family office. The difference is mainly semantic.<br><br>DIY Financial Advisor outlines a stepbystep process through which investors can take control of their hardearned wealth and manage their own family office. Our research indicates that what matters in investing are minimizing psychology traps and managing fees and taxes. These simple concepts apply to all families, not just the ultrawealthy.<br><br>But can or should we be managing our own wealth?<br><br>Our natural inclination is to succumb to the challenge of portfolio management and let an ?expert? deal with the problem.

Our book is meant to be an educational journey that slowly builds confidence in one?s own ability to manage a portfolio. We end our book with a potential solution that could be applicable to a widevariety of investors, from the ultrahigh net worth to middle class individuals, all of whom are focused on similar goals of preserving and growing their capital over time.<br><br>DIY Financial Advisor is a unique resource. This book is the only comprehensive guide to implementing simple quantitative models that can beat the experts. And it comes at the perfect time, as the investment industry is undergoing a significant shift due in part to the use of automated investment strategies that do not require a financial advisor?s involvement.

"Why Religion is Natural and Science is Not The battle between religion and science, competing methods of knowing ourselves and our world, has been raging for many centuries. Now scientists themselves are looking at cognitive foundations of religion--and arriving at some surprising conclusions.<br><br>Over the course of the past two decades, scholars have employed insights gleaned from cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines to illuminate the study of religion. In Why Religion is Natural and Science Is Not, Robert N. McCauley, one of the founding fathers of the cognitive science of religion, argues that our minds are better suited to religious belief than to scientific inquiry. Drawing on the latest research and illustrating his argument with commonsense examples, McCauley argues that religion has existed for many thousands of years in every society because the kinds of explanations it provides are precisely the kinds that come naturally to human minds. Science, on the other hand, is a much more recent and rare development because it reaches radical conclusions and requires a kind of abstract thinking that only arises consistently under very specific social conditions. Religion makes intuitive sense to us, while science requires a lot of work. McCauley then draws out the larger implications of these findings. The naturalness of religion, he suggests, means that science poses no real threat to it, while the unnaturalness of science puts it in a surprisingly precarious position.<br><br>Rigorously argued and elegantly written, this provocative book will appeal to anyone interested in the ongoing debate between religion and science, and in the nature and workings of the human mind.<br><br>ebook comes in .pdf file <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Beginning C# Programming with Unity Note: This edition is for people who plan to use Visual Studio to develop their C# Unity scripts and stand-alone programs. If you plan to use MonoDevelop, you should buy the MonoDevelop edition instead.<br><br>Welcome to the wonderful world of programming! In this book youll learn the basics of programming using the C# programming language. While we admit we love to code (another word for program) just about anything, developing games is one of the coolest things of all. Most of the examples in this book are related to game development using Unity. So youll learn how to program properly and youll learn how to write C# scripts in Unity.<br><br>It's important to note that the Unity focus in this book is on the actual C# scripting you do to build Unity games. The book doesn't cover the full gamut of how to build Unity games from scratch (though we do build a complete game in Chapter 20); instead, we use just enough Unity stuff to build interesting pieces of game functionality so we can concentrate on learning C#. Don't worry, there are plenty of other books and resources for learning the rest of Unity! If you really just want to learn all the nuts and bolts of Unity, you should buy one of those books instead.<br><br>Youll notice we said learn how to program properly above, not whack together games that seem to work. This is a book that focuses on the correct way to write game software (and software in general), so theres lots of discussion about our motivations for the particular design and coding decisions we make throughout the book. <br><br>The book assumes that youve never programmed before, so all the material starts at the most basic level. That means that anyone should be able to pick up the book and work their way through it without any prior knowledge. Thats the good news.<br><br>The bad news is that programming is hard work, especially at first. If you truly want to learn how to program, youll need to write programs yourself and struggle through some rough spots before some topics really click for you. Just as you cant learn how to ride a bicycle by reading about it  you have to actually do it, probably with some spills along the way  you cant learn to program just by reading about it. If you were hoping to read a book to learn how to program without doing any programming yourself, its not going to happen. If you aspire to be a professional game programmer  whether as an indie game developer or in a large game company  and you're willing to put in the work, though, this book will give you a solid foundation for starting on that path. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Left Brain Right Stuff How Leaders Make Winning De Left Brain, Right Stuff takes up where other books about decision making leave off. For many routine choices, from shopping to investing, we can make good decisions simply by avoiding common errors, such as searching only for confirming information or avoiding the hindsight bias. But as Phil Rosenzweig shows, for many of the most important, more complex situations we facein business, sports, politics, and morea different way of thinking is required. Leaders must possess the ability to shape opinions, inspire followers, manage risk, and outmaneuver and outperform rivals.<br><br>Making winning decisions calls for a combination of skills: clear analysis and calculationleft brainas well as the willingness to push boundaries and take bold actionright stuff. Of course leaders need to understand the dynamics of competition, to anticipate rival moves, to draw on the power of statistical analysis, and to be aware of common decision errorsall features of left brain thinking. But to achieve the unprecedented in real-world situations, much more is needed. Leaders also need the right stuff. In business, they have to devise plans and inspire followers for successful execution; in politics, they must mobilize popular support for a chosen program; in the military, commanders need to commit to a battle strategy and lead their troops; and in start-ups, entrepreneurs must manage risk when success is uncertain. In every case, success calls for action as well as analysis, and for courage as well as calculation.<br><br>Always entertaining, often surprising, and immensely practical, Left Brain, Right Stuff draws on a wealth of examples in order to propose a new paradigm for decision making in synch with the way we have to operate in the real world. Rosenzweigs smart and perceptive analysis of research provides fresh, and often surprising, insights on topics such as confidence and overconfidence, the uses and limits of decision models, the illusion of control, expert performance and deliberate practice, competitive bidding and new venture management, and the true nature of leadership.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Microsoft Office Word 2007 (Portable) NO INSTALLATION NEEDED! JUST EXTRACT AND CLICK ON THE .EXE FILE! <br><br>Microsoft Word 2007's document types, interface, and some features--very nearly every aspect of this word processor--have changed. With this update, MS Word becomes a more image-conscious application. New picture-editing tools help you deck out documents and play with fancy fonts. Bloggers and researchers may also benefit. It's easier to get a handle on document security, but those who only need basic typing features may not want to relearn the interface or deal with the new file formats. <br><br>The first thing you'll notice is the completely redesigned toolbar, now known as the Ribbon, with many familiar commands in new places. Instead of the old, gray drop-down menus atop the page, Microsoft's new and very colorful Ribbon clumps common features into tabs: Home, Insert, Page Layout, References, Mailings, Review, and View. Some tabs don't show up until you might need them; for example, you must select a picture to bring up its formatting tab. <br><br>Aside from the interface, the other radical change in Word 2007 is its new file type. For the first time in a decade, Microsoft foists a new file format upon users, and old Word DOC files make way for the new DOCX type of Word 2007. If you primarily work with plain text and don't need to pretty up reports and newsletters and the like, then it might not be right for you. For instance, Word 2007 doesn't introduce must-have blogging goodies, although commenting commands are within easier reach. At the same time, Word 2007 handily presents options for footnotes and citations under its References tab, which researchers should appreciate. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Rich Media Poor Democracy 2015 First published to great acclaim in 2000, Rich Media, Poor Democracy is Robert W. McChesney's magnum opus. Called a rich, penetrating study by Noam Chomsky, the book is a meticulously researched exposition of how U.S. media and communication empires are threatening effective democratic governance. What happens when a few conglomerates dominate all major aspects of mass media, from newspapers and magazines to radio and broadcast television? Since the publication of this prescient work, which won Harvard's Goldsmith Book Prize and the Kappa Tau Alpha Research Award, the concentration of media power and the resultant hypercommercialization of culture has only intensified.<br><br>McChesney lays out his vision for what a truly democratic society might look like, offering compelling suggestions for how the media can be reformed as part of a broader program of democratic renewal. Rich Media, Poor Democracy remains as vital and insightful as ever and continues to serve as an important resource for researchers, students, and anyone who has a stake in the transformation of our digital commons.<br><br>This new edition includes a major new preface by McChesney, where he offers both a history of the transformation in media since the book first appeared; a sweeping account of the organized efforts to reform the media system; and the ongoing threats to our democracy as journalism has continued its sharp decline. <br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Cloud Computing 2016 Most of the information available on cloud computing is either highly technical, with details that are irrelevant to non-technologists, or pure marketing hype, in which the cloud is simply a selling point. This book, however, explains the cloud from the user's viewpoint  the business user's in particular. Nayan Ruparelia explains what the cloud is, when to use it (and when not to), how to select a cloud service, how to integrate it with other technologies, and what the best practices are for using cloud computing. Cutting through the hype, Ruparelia cites the simple and basic definition of cloud computing from the National Institute of Science and Technology: a model enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.<br><br>Thus with cloud computing, businesses can harness information technology resources usually available only to large enterprises. And this, Ruparelia demonstrates, represents a paradigm shift for business. It will ease funding for startups, alter business plans, and allow big businesses greater agility. Ruparelia discusses the key issues for any organization considering cloud computing: service level agreements, business service delivery and consumption, finance, legal jurisdiction, security, and social responsibility.<br><br>He introduces novel concepts made possible by cloud computing: cloud cells, or specialist clouds for specific uses; the personal cloud; the cloud of things; and cloud service exchanges. He examines use case patterns in terms of infrastructure and platform, software information, and business process; and he explains how to transition to a cloud service.

"Logics in Computer Science In this monograph we introduce and examine four new temporal logic formalisms that can be used as specification languages for the automated verification of the reliability of hardware and software designs with respect to a desired behavior. The work is organized in two parts. In the first part two logics for computations, the graded computation tree logic and the computation tree logic with minimal model quantifiers are discussed. These have proved to be useful in describing correct executions of monolithic closed systems. The second part focuses on logics for strategies, strategy logic and memoryful alternating-time temporal logic, which have been successfully applied to formalize several properties of interactive plays in multi-entities systems modeled as multi-agent games. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Ten Billion Tomorrows How Science Fiction Technolo Science fiction is a vital part of popular culture, influencing the way we all look at the world. TV shows like Star Trek and movies from Forbidden Planet to Inception have influenced scientists to enter the profession and have shaped our futures. Science fiction doesn't set out to predict what will happen - it's far more about how human beings react to What if?... - but it is fascinating to see how science fiction and reality sometimes converge, sometimes take extraordinarily different paths.<br><br>Ten Billion Tomorrows brings to life a whole host of science fiction topics, from the virtual environment of The Matrix and the intelligent computer HAL in 2001, to force fields, ray guns and cyborgs. We discover how science fiction has excited us with possibilities, whether it is Star Trek's holodeck inspiring makers of iconic video games Doom and Quake to create the virtual interactive worlds that transformed gaming, or the strange physics that has made real cloaking devices possible. Mixing remarkable science with the imagination of our greatest science fiction writers, Ten Billion Tomorrows will delight science fiction lovers and popular science devotees alike.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Secret Agents Pocket Manual 2012 Most wars have had some element of espionage and subterfuge, but few have included as much as the Second World War, where the all-embracing nature of the conflict, new technology, and the battle of ideologies conspired to make almost everywhere a war zone.<br><br>The occupation of much of Europe in particular left huge areas that could be exploited. Partisans, spies and saboteurs risked everything in a limbo where the normal rules of war were usually suspended. Concealment of oneself, one's weapons and equipment, was vital, and so were the new methods and hardware which were constantly evolving in a bid to stay ahead of the Gestapo and security services.<br><br>Silent killing, disguise, covert communications and the arts of guerrilla warfare were all advanced as the war progressed. With the embodiment and expansion of organisations such as the British SOE and the American OSS, and the supply of special forces units which operated behind enemy lines, clandestine warfare became a permanent part of the modern military and political scene. Perhaps surprisingly many of these hitherto secret techniques and pieces of equipment were put into print at the time and many examples are now becoming available.<br><br>This manual brings together a selection of these dark arts and extraordinary objects and techniques in their original form, under one cover to build up an authentic picture of the Allied spy. <br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Before Babylon Beyond Bitcoin 2017 Technology is changing money and this book looks at where it might be taking us. Technology has transformed money from physical objects to intangible information. With the arrival of smart cards, mobile phones and Bitcoin it has become easier than ever to create new forms of money. Crucially, money is also inextricably connected with our identities. Your card or phone is a security device that can identify you  and link information about you to your money. Dave Birch looks back over the history of money, spanning thousands of years. He sees in the past, both recent and ancient, evidence for several possible futures. Looking further back to a world before cash and central banks, there were multiple currencies' operating at the level of communities, and the use of barter for transactions. Perhaps technology will take us back to the future, a future that began back in 1971, when money became a claim backed by reputation rather than by physical commodities of any kind. Since then, money has been bits. The author shows that these phenomena are not only possible in the future, but already upon us. We may well want to make transactions in Tesco points, Air Miles, Manchester United pounds, Microsoft dollars, Islamic e-gold or Cornish e-tin. The use of cash is already in decline, and is certain to vanish from polite society. The newest technologies will take money back to its origins: a substitute for memory, a record of mutual debt obligations within multiple overlapping communities. This time though, money will be smart. It will be money that reflects the values of the communities that produced it. Future money will know where it has been, who has been using it and what they have been using it for.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Case against the Supreme Court 2014 A preeminent constitutional scholar offers a hard-hitting analysis of the Supreme Court over the last two hundred years<br><br>Most Americans share the perception that the Supreme Court is objective, but Erwin Chemerinsky, one of the countrys leading constitutional lawyers, shows that this is nonsense and always has been. The Court is made up of fallible individuals who base decisions on their own biases. Today, the Roberts Court is promoting a conservative agenda under the guise of following a neutral methodology, but notorious decisions, such as Bush vs. Gore and Citizens United, are hardly recent exceptions. This devastating book details, case by case, how the Court has largely failed throughout American history at its most important tasks and at the most important times.<br><br>Only someone of Chemerinskys stature and breadth of knowledge could take on this controversial topic. Powerfully arguing for term limits for justices and a reassessment of the institution as a whole, The Case Against the Supreme Court is a timely and important book that will be widely read and cited for decades to come.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Scala for the Impatient 2nd edition 2017 Interest in the Scala programming language continues to grow for many reasons. Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java.

"ISIS The Terror Nation 2017 From its birth in the late 1990s as the jihadist dream of terrorist leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi, the Islamic State (known by a variety of names, including ISIS, ISIL, and al Qaeda in Iraq) has grown into a massive enterprise, redrawing national borders across the Middle East and subjecting an area larger than the United Kingdom to its own vicious brand of Sharia law.<br><br>In ISIS: The Terror Nation, world-renowned terrorism expert Loretta Napoleoni builds on her international best-selling The Islamic Phoenix, with new chapters on the Islamic State's recruitment of Western women, economic strategy, and recent terrorist attacks around the world. Napoleoni takes us beyond the headlines, demonstrating that while Western media portrays the Islamic State as little more than a gang of thugs on a winning streak, the organization is proposing a new model for nation building. Waging a traditional war of conquest to carve out the twenty-first-century version of the original Caliphate, ISIS uses modern technology to recruit and fundraise while engaging the local population in the day-to-day running of the new state. Rising from the ashes of failing jihadist enterprises, the Islamic State has shown a deep understanding of Middle Eastern politics, fully exploiting proxy war and shell-state tactics. This is not another terrorist network but a formidable enemy in tune with the new modernity of the current world disorder. As Napoleoni writes, Ignoring these facts is more than misleading and superficial, it is dangerous. 'Know your enemy' remains the most important adage in the fight against terrorism.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

The two men debated the political problems faced by society, and the technological solutions engendered by the global network-from the Arab Spring to Bitcoin. They outlined radically opposing perspectives: for Assange, the liberating power of the Internet is based on its freedom and statelessness. For Schmidt, emancipation is at one with US foreign policy objectives and is driven by connecting non-Western countries to American companies and markets. These differences embodied a tug-of-war over the Internets future that has only gathered force subsequently.<br><br>When Google Met WikiLeaks presents the story of Assange and Schmidts encounter.

"Programming in Lua 4th edition 2016 Lua is spreading more and more throughout different areas of software, from embedded systems and mobile devices to the Web and the Internet of Things. Besides, it has a major role in the game industry, where knowledge of Lua has become an indisputable asset. Lua is the language of choice for anyone who needs a scripting language that is simple, efficient, extensible, portable, and free. Programming in Lua is the official book about the language, providing a solid base to any programmer who wants to use Lua. Authored by Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the language, it covers all aspects of Lua 5---from the basics to its API with C. The book is the main source of programming patterns for Lua, with numerous code examples that help the reader to make the most of Lua's flexibility and powerful mechanisms. Programming in Lua is targeted at people with some programming background, but does not assume any prior knowledge about Lua or other scripting languages. This Fourth Edition updates the book to Lua 5.3 and marks a complete reorganization of the text. Building on his many years of experience teaching Lua, Roberto has restructured the book to present the material in a growing order of complexity, allowing the reader to better absorb the character of the language.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Ghost Train Haze (very potent) 5g - Cannabis cup w This. Is. Madness. Seriously. I was first intrigued by this train long before I ever saw it in a dispensary - it won the 2014 Cannabis cup. It's somewhat difficult to find as I've only seen it in one dispensary, and it is rarely cheap from what I have seen from other places. It's entirely worth it. Read on. The first whiff of this bud is like taking a bite out of some ghost pepper hot sauce when all you've ever had was jalapeno. It's spicy, almost fiery - it has a very exotic, spicy, and floral scent that is completely unique. It's also strong enough to fill up a room, especially after you break it apart for the first time. The nugs are very dense, and the color of the flower ranges from a light, lime green to almost purple in some lines. It's dense, and it definitely feels like an indica at first. When smoked, it has a very strong, harsh flavor. I have been smoking cannabis for a very long time, and few strains can make me cough consistently. GTH does a pretty adequate job of that. It hits hard, and it hits fast. On my first hit, I was dancing to awful TV commercial music. By the second, I felt like I was almost apart of the music. By the third, everything started bending and almost meshing together as one. Very heady stuff - in fact, probably one of the strongest hitting head highs I've ever experienced. It should be noted: I would not recommend this to ANY newcomer to cannabis. This strain is frankly way too strong for you to handle it. If you have experience with cannabis, and you consider yourself to be a connoisseur of sativas - then this, my friends, is your holy grail. Enjoy.<br><br><br>First bred by Rare Dankness, Ghost Train Haze is a sativa cross between Ghost OG and Nevilles Wreck. Unlike typical sativas, Ghost Train Haze grows dense buds blanketed in white, crystal-capped trichomes. With a sour citrus and floral aroma, Ghost Train Haze delivers a potent dose of THC to knock out pain, depression, and appetite loss, but patients prone to anxiety should steer clear of this heavy-hitter. Low doses are conducive to concentration and creativity, but you may notice some cerebral haziness as you administer more.<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai Living and dying with bravery and honor is at the heart of Hagakure, a series of texts written by an eighteenth-century samurai, Yamamoto Tsunetomo. It is a window into the samurai mind, illuminating the concept of bushido (the Way of the Warrior), which dictated how samurai were expected to behave, conduct themselves, live, and die. While Hagakure was for many years a secret text known only to the warrior vassals of the Nabeshima clan to which the author belonged, it later came to be recognized as a classic exposition of samurai thought. <br><br>The original Hagakure consists of over 1,300 short texts that Tsunetomo dictated to a younger samurai over a seven-year period. William Scott Wilson has selected and translated here three hundred of the most representative of those texts to create an accessible distillation of this guide for samurai. No other translator has so thoroughly and eruditely rendered this text into English. <br><br>For this edition, Wilson has added a new introduction that casts Hagakure in a different light than ever before. Tsunetomo refers to bushido as the Way of death, a description that has held a morbid fascination for readers over the years. But in Tsunetomos time, bushido was a nuanced concept that related heavily to the Zen concept of muga, the death of the ego. Wilsons revised introduction gives the historical and philosophical background for that more metaphorical reading of Hagakure, and through this lens, the classic takes on a fresh and nuanced appeal.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This ebook is in .pdf format <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Sects Lies and the Caliphate 2016 Most in the West are loathe to admit that it needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, and that substantial sectors of the Islamic world have indeed declared jihad against any and all enemies, most particularly the Christian world. The worlds second-largest religion is dominated by three elements which must be understood to make sense of this clash of civilizations currently raging. First, Islam is comprised of dozens of sects, not merely Sunnis and Shi`is; and this sectarianism drives many major conflicts.<br><br>To name but the most obvious: Sunni Saudis v. Twelver Shi`i Iranians; Sunni Yemenis v. their Fiver Shi`i (Zaydi) countrymen; the Islamic States Sunnis v. al-Asads Alawis and Iraqis Twelver Shi`is; and across the Islamic world writ large, Salafi Sunnis v. the mystical Sufis of many orders. Second, both major sects of Islam allow Muslims, in effect, to lie to non-Muslims, under a doctrine known as kitman or taqiyya. This makes it rather difficult not only to vett Muslim refugees for terrorists in their midst, but to trust a nation-state like the Islamic Republic of Iran in the diplomatic realm. Finally, many if not most modern Muslims - both jihadist and peaceful - pine for the return of the caliphate, or one-man rule of the Islamic community. Should a more viable contender than ISISs leader ever claim that position, it could prove a great boon, or a massive headache, for the rest of the world.<br><br>The author holds a PhD in Islamic, African, and World history from The Ohio State University. He is a US Army veteran who served in the 101st Airborne Division as an Arabic interrogator, and afterwards worked as a college professor and consultant to US Special Operations Command. His other books are Holiest Wars: Islamic Mahdis, Their Jihads and Osama bin Ladin (2005) and the complementary volume to this work: Ten Years Captivation with the Mahdis Camps: Essays on Muslim Eschatology, 2005-2015 (2015).<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
"Three Minutes to Doomsday 2017 An intense cat-and-mouse game played between two brilliant men in the last days of the Cold War, this shocking insiders story shows how a massive giveaway of secret war plans and nuclear secrets threatened America with annihilation.<br><br>In 1988 Joe Navarro, one of the youngest agents ever hired by the FBI, was dividing his time between SWAT assignments, flying air reconnaissance, and working counter-intelligence. But his real expertise was reading body language. He possessed an uncanny ability to glean the thoughts of those he interrogated.<br><br>So it was that, on a routine assignment to interview a person of interest - a former American soldier named Rod Ramsay - Navarro noticed his interviewees hand trembling slightly when he was asked about another soldier who had recently been arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage. That thin lead was enough for the FBI agent to insist to his bosses that an investigation be opened.<br><br>What followed is unique in the annals of espionage detection - a two-year-long battle of wits. The dueling antagonists: an FBI agent who couldnt overtly tip to his target that he suspected him of wrongdoing lest he clam up, and a traitor whose weakness was the enjoyment he derived from sparring with his inquisitor. Navarros job was made even more difficult by his adversarys brilliance: not only did Ramsay possess an authentic photographic memory as well as the second highest IQ ever recorded by the US Army, he was bored by people who couldnt match his erudition. To ensure that the information flow would continue, Navarro had to pre-choreograph every interview, becoming a chess master plotting twenty moves in advance.<br><br>And the backdrop to this mental tug of war was the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the very real possibility that its leaders, in a last bid to alter the course of history, might launch a devastating attack. If they did, they would have Ramsay to thank, because as Navarro would learn over the course of forty-two mind-bending interviews, Ramsay had, by his stunning intelligence giveaways, handed the Soviets the ability to utterly destroy the US.<br><br>The story of a determined hero who pushed himself to jaw-dropping levels of exhaustion and who rallied his team to expose undreamed of vulnerabilities in Americas defense, Three Minutes to Doomsday will leave the reader with disturbing thoughts of the risks the country takes even today with its most protected national secrets.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Quando le idee, le pratiche e le scorribande nella rete di questa nicchia di sperimentatori telematici iniziarono ad attirare l'attenzione del mainstream, in Italia un manipolo di attivisti ebbe l'intuizione che la comunicazione fosse davvero la sostanza in cui si sarebbero espressi i processi sociali, politici e culturali dell'immediato futuro.

"Terror in the City of Champions - Murder, Baseball Terror in the City of Champions - Murder, Baseball and the Secret Society That Shocked depression era<br><br><br>Publisher: The Lyons Press (1 Aug. 2016)<br>Language: English<br>ISBN-10: 1493015702<br>ISBN-13: 978-1493015702<br><br>A New York Times Bestseller Detroit, mid-1930s: In a city abuzz over its unrivaled sports success, gun-loving baseball fan Dayton Dean became ensnared in the nefarious and deadly Black Legion. The secretive, Klan-like group was executing a wicked plan of terror, murdering enemies, flogging associates, and contemplating armed rebellion. The Legion boasted tens of thousands of members across the Midwest, among them politicians and prominent citizens-even, possibly, a beloved athlete. Terror in the City of Champions opens with the arrival of Mickey Cochrane, a fiery baseball star who roused the Great Depression's hardest-hit city by leading the Tigers to the 1934 pennant. A year later he guided the team to its first championship. Within seven months the Lions and Red Wings follow in football and hockey-all while Joe Louis chased boxing's heavyweight crown. Amidst such glory, the Legion's dreadful toll grew unchecked: staged ""suicides,"" bodies dumped along roadsides, high-profile assassination plots. Talkative Dayton Dean's involvement would deepen as heroic Mickey's Cochrane's reputation would rise. But the ballplayer had his own demons, including a close friendship with Harry Bennett, Henry Ford's brutal union buster. Award-winning author Tom Stanton weaves a stunning tale of history, crime, and sports. Richly portraying 1930s America, Terror in the City of Champions features a pageant of colorful figures: iconic athletes, sanctimonious criminals, scheming industrial titans, a bigoted radio priest, a love-smitten celebrity couple, J. Edgar Hoover, and two future presidents, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. It is a rollicking true story set at the confluence of hard luck, hope, victory, and violence. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Someone with<br>superuser access to the last mail server to handle the message can completely spoof the message, but<br>others cannot. Therefore, the email itself contains the most important clues regarding its authenticity. In<br>conjunction with this data, it might be possible to ascertain the path of the email by accessing the logs<br>of routers and especially those of email servers on the way. Not all email can be traced, for example, if<br>the sender used an anonymizer service and the investigator cannot access the logs of the service.<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Cloning Credit Cards A combined pre-play and downgrade<br>attack on EMV Contactless<br><br>Recent roll-outs of contactless payment infrastruc-<br>tures  particularly in Austria and Germany  have<br>raised concerns about the security of contactless pay-<br>ment cards and Near Field Communication (NFC).<br>There are well-known attack scenarios like relay at-<br>tacks and skimming of credit card numbers. How-<br>ever, banks and credit card schemes often mitigate<br>these attacks. They explain that attacks are im-<br>practical (e.g. in a relay attack an attacker needs<br>to have RF access to a victims card while perform-<br>ing a payment transaction) or even impossible (e.g.<br>skimmed data does not contain the dynamic autho-<br>rization codes that are normally required to perform<br>a payment transaction). This paper introduces an<br>attack scenario on EMV contactless payment cards<br>that permits an attacker to create functional clones<br>of a card that contain the necessary credit card data<br>as well as pre-played authorization codes. The card<br>clones can then be used to perform a limited num-<br>ber of EMV Mag-Stripe transactions at any EMV<br>contactless payment terminal<br><br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"BLACKSHADES 5.5.1 RAT BLACKSHADES 5.5.1 RAT<br>----------------------------<br>Blackshades infects computer systems by downloading onto a victim's computer when the victim accesses a malicious webpage (sometimes downloading onto the victim's computer without the victim's knowledge, known as a drive-by download) or through external storage devices, such as USB flash drives. Blackshades also included tools that assisted hackers in maximizing the amount of computer systems infected, such as a tool that sends infected links that masquerade as an innocuous site to other potential victims via the victim's social networking service.<br>Blackshades can reportedly be used remotely to access an infected computer without authorization. Blackshades allows hackers to perform many actions on an infected computer remotely without authorization, including the ability to:<br>Access and modify files on the victim's computer.<br>Log keystrokes on the victim's computer.<br>Access to the webcam of the victim.<br>Include the victim's computer in a botnet, which allows the attacker to perform denial-of-service attacks with the victim's computer, and usually along with other infected computers.<br>Download and execute files on the victim's computer.<br>Use the victim's computer as a proxy server.  <br>","D3DreamMarket","YES"

"Network Reliability Measures and Evaluation 2016 In Engineering theory and applications, we think and operate in terms of logics and models with some acceptable and reasonable assumptions. The present text is aimed at providing modelling and analysis techniques for the evaluation of reliability measures (2-terminal, all-terminal, k-terminal reliability) for systems whose structure can be described in the form of a probabilistic graph. Among the several approaches of network reliability evaluation, the multiple-variable-inversion sum-of-disjoint product approach finds a well-deserved niche as it provides the reliability or unreliability expression in a most efficient and compact manner. However, it does require an efficiently enumerated minimal inputs (minimal path, spanning tree, minimal k-trees, minimal cut, minimal global-cut, minimal k-cut) depending on the desired reliability. The present book covers these two aspects in detail through the descriptions of several algorithms devised by the reliability fraternity and explained through solved examples to obtain and evaluate 2-terminal, k-terminal and all-terminal network reliability/unreliability measures and could be its USP. The accompanying web-based supplementary information containing modifiable Matlab source code for the algorithms is another feature of this book.<br><br>A very concerted effort has been made to keep the book ideally suitable for first course or even for a novice stepping into the area of network reliability. The mathematical treatment is kept as minimal as possible with an assumption on the readers side that they have basic knowledge in graph theory, probabilities laws, Boolean laws and set theory.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
"Edison vs Tesla The Battle over Their Last Inventi Thomas Edison closely following the alternative physics work of Albert Einstein and Max Planck, convincing him that there was an entire reality unseen by the human eye. This led to the last and least-known of all Edisons inventions, the spirit phone. His former associate, now bitter rival, Nikola Tesla, was also developing at the same time a similar mysterious device. Edison vs. Tesla examines their quest to talk to the dead. It reveals:<br><br>Edisons little-known near-death experience formed his theory that animate life forms dont die, but rather change the nature of their composition. It is this foundational belief that drove him to proceed with the spirit phone.<br><br>Tesla monitored Edisons paranormal work, with both men racing to create a device that picked up the frequencies of discarnate spirits, what today is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).<br><br>Both men were way ahead of their time, delving into artificial intelligence and robotics.<br>Although mystery and lore surround the details of the last decade of Edisons life, many skeptics have denied the existence of the mysterious spirit phone. The authors have researched both Edisons and Teslas journals, as well as contemporary articles and interviews with the inventors to confirm that tests were actually done with this device.<br><br>They also have the full cooperation of the Charles Edison fund, affording them access to rare photos and graphics to support their text. Edison vs. Tesla sheds light on this weird invention and demonstrates the rivalry that drove both men to new discoveries.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

It has been owned by Kalmbach Publishing since 2010.<br>Discover was created primary through the efforts of Time magazine editor Leon Jaroff. He noticed that magazine sales jumped every time the cover featured a science topic. Jaroff interpreted this as a considerable public interest in science, and in 1971 he began agitating for the creation of a science-oriented magazine. This was difficult, as a former colleague noted, because ""Selling science to people who graduated to be managers was very difficult"".<br>Jaroff's persistence finally paid off, and Discover magazine published its first edition in 1980] Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than Popular Science. Shortly after its launch, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) launched a similar magazine called Science 80 (not to be confused with its flagship academic journal), and both Science News and Science Digest changed their formats to follow the new trend. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Drugs the Straight Facts Quaaludes 2008 In the 1960s, methaqualone - sold in the United States as the trademark Quaalude - was widely prescribed as a treatment for insomnia and anxiety. However, it soon became apparent that quaaludes were highly addictive and had a strong potential for recreational abuse. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, quaaludes were extremely popular due to their ability to produce a drunk-like state without a hangover. After years of scientific research revealed the harmful short- and long-term effects of using quaaludes, the drugs were made illegal and pulled from the market in most countries. However, quaaludes continue to be abused in many developing nations. Quaaludes covers the history of the drugs, the physical and psychological effects, their impact on the brain, their dangers of use and abuse, the portrayal of quaaludes in the media, and treatments for quaalude addiction. Chapters of this title include: An Overview of Depressant Drugs; What Are Quaaludes?; Past and Present Use of Quaaludes; The Neuroscience of Quaalude Use; The Physical and Psychological Effects of Quaaludes; Quaaludes in the Popular Media; and, Problems Associated with the Use of Quaaludes.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Design for Hackers Reverse-Engineering Beauty 2011 Hackers are able to accomplish so much in so little time because they come from a community that's built upon sharing knowledge. When it comes to programming, they can learn whatever they need to learn by reading manuals, or simply typing in a Google search. But learning design isn't so simple.<br><br>Many design books try to teach design through lists of do's and don'ts. But hackers know you need a deeper understanding of something to really do it well. Design for Hackers takes apart design by reverse-engineering Impressionist painting, Renaissance sculpture, the Mac OS X Aqua interface, Twitter's web interface, and much more. You'll learn about color theory, typography, proportions, and design principles. This theoretical advice is mixed with concrete, actionable advice such as suggestions for color scheme tools, and a chart of all of the fonts you'll ever need.<br><br>By the end of the book, you'll be seeing design through new eyes.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Exploring ES6 Upgrade to the Next Version of JavaS You are reading a book about ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a new version of JavaScript. Its great that we can finally use that version, which had a long and eventful past: It was first conceived as ECMAScript 4, a successor to ECMAScript 3 (whose release was in December 1999). In July 2008, plans changed and the next versions of JavaScript were to be first a small incremental release (which became ES5) and then a larger, more powerful release. The latter had the code name Harmony and part of it became ES6.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The History Thieves Secrets Lies & the Shaping of  In 1889, the first Official Secrets Act was passed, creating offences of 'disclosure of information' and 'breach of official trust'. It limited and monitored what the public could, and should, be told. Since then a culture of secrecy has flourished. As successive governments have been selective about what they choose to share with the public, we have been left with a distorted and incomplete understanding not only of the workings of the state but of our nation's culture and its past.<br><br>In this important new book, Ian Cobain offers a fresh appraisal of some of the key moments in British history since the end of WWII, including: the measures taken to conceal the existence of Bletchley Park and its successor, GCHQ, for three decades; the unreported wars fought during the 1960s and 1970s; the hidden links with terrorist cells during the Troubles; the sometimes opaque workings of the criminal justice system; the state's peacetime surveillance techniques; and the convenient loopholes in the Freedom of Information Act.<br><br>Drawing on previously unseen material and rigorous research, The History Thieves reveals how a complex bureaucratic machine has grown up around the British state, allowing governments to evade accountability and their secrets to be buried.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Cyberactivism on the Participatory Web examines the impact of these new technologies on political organizing and protest across the political spectrum, from the Arab Spring to artists to far-right groups. Linking new information and communication technologies to possibilities for solidarity and action - as well as surveillance and control - in a context of global capital flow, war, and environmental crisis, the contributors to this volume provide nuanced analyses of the dramatic transformations in media, citizenship, and social movements taking place today.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Anonymous SMS on TOR  i'll tell you where to get mobile phone numbers, using Bitcoin and TOR, completely anonymously.<br>They don't even take an email address if you don't want to supply one. You can send and receive SMS text messages on these anonymous numbers using theyr .onion web interface. <br>Many  numbers can receive voice calls as voicemail messages, and we also provide physical numbers so that messages can not be filtered by the upstream virtual number provider. <br><br>We use an SMS API service to buy the virtual numbers and to send and receive the messages. This means we are able to offer numbers in a wide range of countries without needing any physical presence in those countries. The downside of using an API provider, instead of operating physical phones, is that the API provider can see all the messages. And, more importantly, our API provider blocks the messages that are involved for signing up to some online services. This is a shame as we believe any communications service should provide an unfiltered flow of communication. Note, however, that voicemail messages are not blocked in this manner.<br><br>We also offer physical numbers, which we operate with real mobile phone numbers. We're not aware of any message filtering when using this service: it's as good as having a real phone in your hand. <br>","D3DreamMarket","YES"

"The Darkening Web The War for Cyberspace 2017 No single invention of the last half century has changed the way we live now as much as the Internet. Alexander Klimburg was a member of the generation for whom it was a utopian ideal turned reality: a place where ideas, information, and knowledge could be shared and new freedoms found and enjoyed. Two decades later, the future isnt so bright any more: increasingly, the Internet is used as a weapon and a means of domination by states eager to exploit or curtail global connectivity in order to further their national interests.<br> <br>Klimburg is a leading voice in the conversation on the implications of this dangerous shift, and in The Darkening Web, he explains why we underestimate the consequences of states ambitions to project power in cyberspace at our peril: Not only have hacking and cyber operations fundamentally changed the nature of political conflict - ensnaring states in a struggle to maintain a precarious peace that could rapidly collapse into all-out war - but the rise of covert influencing and information warfare has enabled these same global powers to create and disseminate their own distorted versions of reality in which anything is possible. At stake are not only our personal data or the electrical grid, but the Internet as we know it today - and with it the very existence of open and democratic societies.<br> <br>Blending anecdote with argument, Klimburg brings us face-to-face with the range of threats the struggle for cyberspace presents, from an apocalyptic scenario of debilitated civilian infrastructure to a 1984-like erosion of privacy and freedom of expression. Focusing on different approaches to cyber-conflict in the US, Russia and China, he reveals the extent to which the battle for control of the Internet is as complex and perilous as the one surrounding nuclear weapons during the Cold War - and quite possibly as dangerous for humanity as a whole.<br><br>Authoritative, thought-provoking, and compellingly argued, The Darkening Web makes clear that the debate about the different aspirations for cyberspace is nothing short of a war over our global values.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Republic of Spin An Inside History of the American The most powerful political tool of the modern presidency is control of the message and the image.<br><br>In Republic of Spin-a vibrant history covering more than one hundred years of politics-presidential historian David Greenberg recounts the rise of the White House spin machine, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama. His sweeping, startling narrative takes us behind the scenes to see how the tools and techniques of image making and message craft work. We meet Woodrow Wilson convening the first White House press conference, Franklin Roosevelt huddling with his private pollsters, Ronald Reagans aides crafting his nightly news sound bites, and George W. Bush staging his Mission Accomplished photo-op. We meet, too, the backstage visionaries who pioneered new ways of gauging public opinion and mastering the media-figures like George Cortelyou, TRs brilliantly efficient press manager; 1920s ad whiz Bruce Barton; Robert Montgomery, Dwight Eisenhowers canny TV coach; and of course the key spinmeisters of our own times, from Roger Ailes to David Axelrod.<br><br>Greenberg also examines the profound debates Americans have waged over the effect of spin on our politics. Does spin help our leaders manipulate the citizenry? Or does it allow them to engage us more fully in the democratic project? Exploring the ideas of the centurys most incisive political critics, from Walter Lippmann and H. L. Mencken to Hannah Arendt and Stephen Colbert, Republic of Spin illuminates both the power of spin and its limitations-its capacity not only to mislead but also to lead.<br>24 pages of illustrations<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Hagakure The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai 2014 The comprehensive and accurate edition of the Hagakure is a must-have for serious martial artists or fans of samurai and the bushido code.<br><br>The Hagakure is one of the most influential of all Japanese texts - written nearly 300 years ago by Yamamoto Tsunetomo to summarize the very essence of the Japanese Samurai bushido (warrior) spirit. Its influence has been felt throughout the world and yet its existence is scarcely known to many Westerners. This is the first translation to include the complete first two books of the Hagakure and the most reliable and authentic passages contained within the third book; all other English translations published previously have been extremely fragmentary and incomplete.<br><br>Alex Bennett's completely new and highly readable translation of this essential work includes extensive footnotes that serve to fill in many cultural and historical gaps in the previous translations.

"Murachs Java Programming 4th edition 2011 Developers often tell me they wish they'd found our Java book first, before spending time and money on others. They also say it's the book they turn to when they're getting ready to learn Android programming. Here are a few of the reasons why I believe this book will work equally well for you:<br><br>This book teaches the core Java skills that you need to work with objects, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), files, and databases.<br>It gives you a fast start! In fact, by the end of chapter 6, you'll be developing bulletproof Java applications with business classes and objects.<br>It now shows you how to use the NetBeans IDE to code, test, and debug Java applications. This easy-to-use tool boosts your productivity and is widely used in industry. So you'll be working like a pro right from the start.<br>It takes the mystery out of object-oriented programming by using real-world applications (instead of objects like cats and dogs) to demonstrate key concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.<br>It covers the most useful features introduced in Java SE 7, like the try-with-resources statement, the diamond operator (<>), and an improved file system API (known as NIO2).<br>In the GUI section, it shows you how to use the NetBeans Swing GUI builder to design a form and generate the code needed to display it. As a result, this section has you focus on critical coding skills, such as handling events, instead of on code that should be generated.<br>Because business applications routinely handle data, it shows how to work with text files, binary files, XML files, and databases (using JDBC).<br>It now has a chapter on deploying applications by using executable JAR files or Java Web Start.<br>It gives you the Java skills that you need to get started with Android programming. That's true whether you're looking to refresh your skills...or whether you're learning Java for the first time.<br>All the skills are presented in our standard, paired-pages format, to save you time on both training and reference.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Organized Crime collection of essays in the tradition of Austrian political economya combination of applied economics and the study of governmental reality. Unlike mainstream economists who are content to spin mathematical model after mathematical model which explain little or nothing about the real world, DiLorenzos focus has always been just the oppositeto use economic understanding to gain a better understanding of how the political-economic world works. Austrian economics is indispensable to succeed at this task. The book is divided into six sections: Coercion and Regulation analyzes various aspects of government regulation of business; Politics and Thieves is of course about the inherent nature of government; Centralization versus Liberty discusses the never-ending quest by statists to monopolize and centralize political power so as to isolate themselves as much as possible from public influence; Money and the State describes the myriad evils of central banking, which was always thought of by its original proponents in America as an engine of corruption; Workers and Unions discusses various labor union myths and superstitions that too often cloud the publics thinking about the reality of labor markets; and Truth and Lies about Markets is a taxonomy of some of the main market-failure myths that have long been used to illegitimately advance the cause of economic interventionism, as well as some newer ones. In Organized Crime: The Unvarnished Truth About Government, Thomas J. DiLorenzo strips away the vast apparatus of establishment propaganda and exposes the government smokescreen. No statist lies are safe from his scrutiny. In his straightforward and methodical approach to uncovering truths of freedom, liberty has a champion.<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Sexy Curves !!! Boudoir photographs are intimate images created of a woman in a private (read intimate) space. The term boudoir, in translation, means bedroom, and images created in the boudoir stylewhether they are indeed created in a womans boudoir or in a makeshift bedroom within the walls of a photographic studioare strictly feminine. The subjects may be adorned in fine lingerie, or perhaps may be shown in the act of dressingor undressing. The images are sensual, flirty, and always beautiful.<br><br>Clients book boudoir sessions to celebrate their sensuality and femininity. For some, the goal is to document a special phase in life or simply to find a new way to see herself. Other women seek to book a boudoir session with the goal of providing a significant other with a highly personal and perhaps playful gift. Regardless of her motivation, her expectation is that her photographer will be able to amplify her assets, minimize any perceived figure flaws, and create a beautiful, evocative work of art.<br><br>In order to meetand exceedher clients expectations, photographers must have a wealth of technical knowledge (just which camera angles, exposure settings, lens selections, and lighting patterns will create the desired look?) and a facility with coaxing form-flattering poses that lengthen legs, whittle waistlines, enhance the bust, and somehow look and feel natural, not contrived. The expression that is elicited must suit the mood of the image, too. And, of course, there are fragile egos at play. Yes, working with a scantily clad subject under the scrutiny of a lens is a tall order. Sadly, each of those concerns can seem magnified when working with the plus-sized boudoir subject.<br><br>In this book, Tammy Warnock presents a tangible, easy-to-follow recipe for creating va-va-voom images of plus-size clients that celebrate every sexy curve. She introduces readers to 60 real-life subjects and investigates the intricate details of conceptualizing and crafting a sensational plus-size boudoir session. For each session presented for review, readers will learn about the clients objectives (Why did she book the shoot? What was the mood or feeling or theme she had in mind?). Tammy will share the strategies she used to create rapport with the client, boost her confidence, and ensure a positive, praise- (and referral!) worthy experience. The artistic elements of the shot (backdrops, props, and styling) and corrective posing and lighting strategies are detailed as well, culminating in an inspiring and instructional framework that readers will rely on whenever any boudoir subject calls for services. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

While forensics is commonly thought of as a function of a legal investigation, the same tactics and techniques used for those investigations are also important in a response to an incident.

The skills of a forensic investigator are critical to determine the source of the attack as well as the impact.

"Free Speech Free speech may be your right, but unless you fight for it, you'll lose it. That is the message of Free Speech Isn't Free, which chronicles how organizing a lecture tour for masculine men inserted Roosh Valizadeh into an unexpected free speech fight spanning several continents, putting both him and his family in danger from the globalist establishment and their mob of deranged social justice warriors.<br><br>After becoming activated by mass-scale media distortions and mayoral denouncements, the SJW mob in Canada rose up against Roosh and his followers to halt his tour. Roosh refused to cancel and set out to hold the lectures in secret. He shares how he fought back against the mob while trying to come to terms with the globalist agenda that they're controlled by. The well-informed men he met throughout the tour were critical in sharing hidden knowledge that put the agenda's puzzle pieces into place.<br><br>Even after the lecture, when Roosh tried to conduct happy hour meetings for his followers, a bigger worldwide outrage befell him, leading to the doxing of his family and threats to burn their house to the ground. Free Speech Isn't Free shares that story for the first time in a special epilogue, and what was going through the mind of a man who was the number one target for a 1984-inspired ""two minutes of hate"" that took place worldwide.<br><br>How far will you go if the establishment attacks you for what you believe in? Are you ready to defend yourself if they come after your reputation, your job, and your family? Free Speech Isn't Free shows what one man did when powerful groups tried to silence him, along with everything he learned during the most momentous months of his life that will help others be able to identify and defend against attacks within their own lives.<br><br>Bonuses included are the transcript of the ""dangerous"" speech that started it all, The State Of Man, and an important new article explaining how to keep yourself safe from social justice attacks. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Bromocriptine: An Old Drug With New Uses Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist drug (meaning that it acts like dopamine in the brain) that has been used for over three decades for the treatment of a number of conditions such as Parkinsons disease, acromegaly (the disease Andre The Giant had), and overproduction of the hormone prolactin. You may be wondering what this has to do with the topic of body composition.<br><br>As I discuss in many of my articles and other books, the body regulates factors such as body weight, composition and appetite through a variety of hormones such as insulin and leptin. It turns out that those hormones exert at least part of their effect through dopamine levels in the brain. When people diet, dopamine levels drop in the brain and this is responsible for many of the effects (such as lowered metabolic rate, increased hunger, etc.) that occur.<br><br>My book Bromocriptine starts by outlining the systems that regulate body weight and fat levels before explaining how the drug bromocriptine can trick the body into thinking that its not dieting so that metabolic rate doesnt slow, hunger is decreased, etc. Side effects, dosing and everything else related to the drug and how it can be used for various purposes related to body composition are outlined in detail in the book.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This ebook is in .pdf format <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"NATO's Secret Armies Operation Gladio & Terrorism  This fascinating new study shows how the CIA and the British secret service, in collaboration with the military alliance NATO and European military secret services, set up a network of clandestine anti-communist armies in Western Europe after World War II.<br><br>These secret soldiers were trained on remote islands in the Mediterranean and in unorthodox warfare centres in England and in the United States by the Green Berets and SAS Special Forces. The network was armed with explosives, machine guns and high-tech communication equipment hidden in underground bunkers and secret arms caches in forests and mountain meadows. In some countries the secret army linked up with right-wing terrorist who in a secret war engaged in political manipulation, harrassement of left wing parties, massacres, coup d'etats and torture.<br><br>Codenamed 'Gladio' ('the sword'), the Italian secret army was exposed in 1990 by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to the Italian Senate, whereupon the press spoke of The best kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II (Observer, 18. November 1990) and observed that The story seems straight from the pages of a political thriller. (The Times, November 19, 1990). Ever since, so-called 'stay-behind' armies of NATO have also been discovered in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Greece and Turkey.

"Citizen Spies The Long Rise of Americas Surveillan The history of recruiting citizens to spy on each other in the United States.<br><br>Ever since the revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden, we think about surveillance as the data-tracking digital technologies used by the likes of Google, the National Security Administration, and the military. But in reality, the state and allied institutions have a much longer history of using everyday citizens to spy and inform on their peers. Citizen Spies shows how If You See Something, Say Something is more than just a new homeland security program; it has been an essential civic responsibility throughout the history of the United States. <br><br>From the town crier of Colonial America to the recruitment of youth through junior police, to the rise of Neighborhood Watch, AMBER Alerts, and Emergency 9-1-1, Joshua Reeves explores how ordinary citizens have been taught to carry out surveillance on their peers. Emphasizing the role humans play as seeing and saying subjects, he demonstrates how American society has continuously fostered cultures of vigilance, suspicion, meddling, snooping, and snitching. Tracing the evolution of police crowd-sourcing from Hue and Cry posters and Americas Most Wanted to police-affiliated social media, as well as the U.S.s recurrent anxieties about political dissidents and ethnic minorities from the Red Scare to the War on Terror, Reeves teases outhow vigilance toward neighbors has long been aligned with American ideals of patriotic and moral duty. Taking the long view of the history of the citizen spy, this book offers a much-needed perspective for those interested in how we arrived at our current moment in surveillance culture and contextualizes contemporary trends in policing.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

But despite the hype, Tyrannosaurus and the other tyrannosaurs are fascinating animals in their own right, and are among the best-studied of all dinosaurs.<br><br>Tyrannosaurs started small, but over the course of 100 million years evolved into the giant carnivorous bone-crushers that continue to inspire awe in palaeontologists, screenplay writers, sci-fi novelists and the general public alike. Tyrannosaurus itself was truly impressive; it topped six tons, was more than 12m (40 feet) long, and had the largest head and most powerful bite of any land animal in history.<br><br>The Tyrannosaur Chronicles tracks the rise of these dinosaurs, and presents the latest research into their biology, showing off more than just their impressive statistics - tyrannosaurs had feathers and fought and even ate each other. This book presents the science behind this research; it tells the story of the group through their anatomy, ecology and behaviour, exploring how they came to be the dominant terrestrial predators of the Mesozoic and, in more recent times, one of the great icons of biology. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"An Introduction to Network Programming with Java 3 Since the second edition of this text, the use of the Internet and networks generally has continued to expand at a phenomenal rate. This has led to both an increase in demand for network software and to improvements in the technology used to run such networks, with the latter naturally leading to changes in the former. During this time, the Java libraries have been updated to keep up with the new developments in network technology, so that the Java programming language continues to be one of the mainstays of network software development.<br><br>In providing a very readable text that avoids getting immersed in low-level technical details, while still providing a useful, practical guide to network programming for both undergraduates and busy IT professionals, this third edition continues the trend of its predecessors.

"Order without Power An Introduction to Anarchism 2 With the rise of the global protestor - from Arab Spring to the Occupy movement - the term anarchist has been littered throughout mainstream media as never before. But just as frequently, its definition is skewed or left wanting: anarchists are painted as nihilists, supporters of chaos, or even terrorists.<br><br>In Order without Power, an informative primer, Normand Baillargeon thoroughly defines anarchism and recounts its long history. In outlining the forerunners of this movement, he illuminates the differences between collectivists, federalists, communists, syndicalists, and further strains such as anarcho-feminism, pacifist anarchism, and religious anarchism. With sharp examples and concise, lively language, Baillargeon describes the contributions from early anarchists like William Godwin, Max Stirner, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and Pierre Kropotkin, through Noam Chomsky, as well as the uprisings, struggles, revolts, and revolutions that tested or expanded the theories. From the International Workingmens Association to Haymarket, from the Russian Revolution to May 1968, Baillargeon unpacks anarchisms position on various issues and reveals this political theorys vibrant heart: anti authoritarianism, or the rational and conscious refusal of any form of illegitimate authority and power.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Today's talented brewers are innovating, experimenting, and enthusiastically embracing the seemingly mystical complexity of flavors and aromas derived from wood. From the souring effects of microbes that take up residence in the wood to the wood character drawn from barrels or foeders, this book covers not only the history, physiology, microbiology, and flavor contributions of wood, but also the maintenance of wooden vessels. Explore the many influences of wood as a vehicle for contributing tremendous complexity to beers fermented and aged within it.

We just received a fresh batch of our premium White Maeng Da, Red Borneo, Green Bali, Gold, and Super Green kratom! We ship same day as ordered whenever possible and offer priority mail. We want to offer the best service and quality to our customers. If you hear of another kratom strain you would like to try just let me know and I can probably get it. I've tried to offer some of the most popular strains. Also check at our reviews on Alphabay and Reddit!<br><br>For Sale:<br>The highest-quality Kratom capsules on the Dark Net: 750mg/cap (actual kratom powder weight, excluding capsule) gold-veined Kratom size-000 capsules. These are tamped (i.e. pressed) and made with the more expensive size-000 capsule, rather than the usual size-00. They are 150% larger than other online sellers which sell 300mg size-00 capsules not tamped.<br><br>Capsule source information:<br>Capsules are from Capsulcn and are regular gelatin capsules size-000:<br>http://store.capsulcn.com/Capsules-gelatin-000/Clear<br><br>Capsules will be shipped via Priority Mail in a vacuum-sealed stand-up sealed food grade pouch.<br><br>First, to clear the air, why sell on the darknet a legal substance?<br>Basically, it boils down to two things: 1) the darknet is a more sophisticated crowd when it comes to new (to the US) substances, so I'm not viewed in a ""wild"" or negative light here. 2) Some people on here are heavily addicted to opiates, want out of the dependency without suffering so much withdrawal, and Kratom is a good path to ween off opiates. Getting off Kratom, then, is relatively easy for _most_ people.<br><br>What is Kratom?<br>Kratom is from a tree of the species Mitragyna speciosa which grows in tropical climates such as Indonesia. Mitragyna speciosa is a tropical deciduous and evergreen tree in the coffee family (Rubiaceae) native to Southeast Asia in the Indochina and Malaysia floristic regions. (for detailed information, please refer to the wiki page)<br><br>Kratom target effect:<br>Deep pain relief, cheerfulness, increased sociability, anti-anxiety, mild euphoria, increased ability for heavy labor (I take it hiking all the time). Kratom comes in three vein-color variants (although the leaf proper is always green) - red, green, and white. In my experience, white-veined Kratom is less sedating and more euphoric in nature than red or green. Green is the most sedating whereas red is somewhere in-between. Note this is my subjective opinion only as gathered from years of person experience.<br><br>Dosage:<br>Recommended dosage is 4 to 8 capsules which is somewhere around 3 to 7 grams, but the initial dosage should be no more than 3 capsules.<br><br>Contradictions:<br>Kratom does not interact negatively with any other drug that I know. However, it could increase the effect of traditional opiates.<br>Duration of primary effects: 2-4 hours<br>No extraction of the Kratom is done. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Secret Societies of Americas Elite 2nd edition 200 An expose of the dark and critical role secret societies play within the ruling families in America and their influence on American democracy, current events, and world history.<br><br>Reveals the enormous influence secret societies still have on contemporary American life.<br><br>Shows how the secret Masonic cells that smuggled in the democratic ideals inspiring the American Revolution also enabled the future elite of the new society to build huge fortunes.<br><br>Elite and secret societies have always been a major force in the history of Western civilization. The alliances formed in secret societies such as the Knights Templar, the Knights of Christ, and the Freemasons transcended patriotism and religious beliefs and had a powerful influence on the establishment of the United States of America. While these secret associations of merchants, smugglers, occultists, gamblers, spies, and slavers succeeded in freeing the United States from foreign domination, the dark side is that the elite used their secret connections to further their own wealth and power. These secret cells did not hesitate to sponsor the assassination of a president and even attempted to break up the union on several occasions when it was deemed expedient.<br><br>From the Sons of Liberty and the Essex Junto to the Ku Klux Klan, secret societies have played critical roles in building the fortunes of America's elite. Now Steven Sora reveals in alarming detail how secretive societies continue to wield power even today as organizations such as Yale's Skull & Bones unite America's modern ruling families as strongly as Masonic Lodges once connected the Astors, Livingstons, and Roosevelts. Their immense power and wealth allow this elite to control America to an even greater degree than the Templars once dominated Europe.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Knowledge Corrupters Hidden Consequences of th In principle the advanced, market-driven world in which we now live is fuelled by knowledge, information and transparency, but in practice the processes that produce this world systematically corrupt and denigrate knowledge: this is the powerful and provocative argument advanced by Colin Crouch in his latest exploration of societies on the road to post-democracy.<br><br>Crouch shows that executives in profit-maximizing corporations have incentives to ignore or distort knowledge, especially firms in the information business of the mass media themselves, as financial knowledge increasingly trumps the other kinds of knowledge that business needs. Firms also seek to take control of public knowledge and use it for their own ends, often at the cost of other stakeholders in society. Meanwhile the transfer of similar practices to professional public services undermines professional skills and ethics - especially when these services are out-sourced to the private sector. Attempts to extricate ourselves from these problems involve reshaping the complex and often conflicting relationships among citizens, professionals, managers and financiers.<br><br>This new book by one of the most incisive critics of contemporary Western societies will be of interest to a wide range of readers, from students to policy-makers and those who work in the public and private sectors.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

Snipers must be able to apply the craft in an urban environment or alone on a hostile mountain top with equal effectiveness. Todays sniper must not just leverage technological advances but also have the foreknowledge to select the best rifle and gear for the mission.

"Born in Blood The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry 1989 Its mysterious symbols and rituals had been used in secret for centuries before Freemasonry revealed itself in London in 1717. Once known, Freemasonry spread throughout the world and attracted kings, emperors, and statesmen to take its sacred oaths. It also attracted great revolutionaries such as George Washington and Sam Houston in America, Juarez in Mexico, Garibaldi in Italy, and Bolivar in South America. It was outlawed over the centuries by Hitler, Mussolini, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. But where had this powerful organization come from? What was it doing in those secret centuries before it rose from underground more than 270 years ago? And why was Freemasonry attacked with such intense hatred by the Roman Catholic church?<br><br>This amazing detective story answers those questions and proves that the Knights Templar in Britain, fleeing arrest and torture by pope and king, formed a secret society of mutual protection that came to be called Freemasonry. Based on years of meticulous research, this book solves the last remaining mysteries of the Masons - their secret words, symbols, and allegories whose true meanings had been lost in antiquity. With a richly drawn background of the bloody battles, the opportunistic kings and scheming popes, the tortures and religious persecution throughout the Middle Ages, it is an important book that may require that we take a new look at the history of events leading to the Protestant Reformation.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Designer Drugs Directory This book is intended to serve as quick reference handbook on so-called designer drugs. These new, mainly synthetic compounds are also often referred to as analogues of controlled substances. This new work provides a unique directory of 104 designer drugs. This class of drugs is rapidly growing in variety and number of compounds. Although identification, toxicology and other properties have been thoroughly investigated, their analogues and derivatives remain poorly documented. This book fills the gap. Data which is available is often contradictory and confused. This directory provides a critical treatment of the subject which is thoroughly indexed including both the subject index and an index listing more that 230 street names of the described designer drugs. Divided into two parts; the first section describes aspects of designer drug manufacture, new abuse trends, sources of information and terminology. The second, descriptive part, classifies the drugs into ten main categories according to their chemical structure and prevalent pharmacological action. A separate chapter is devoted to each category, followed by a set of corresponding data sheets, street names and eventual synonyms, Toxicological data, short notes on the history of drugs as well as the most pertinent bibliographic references are included.  <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

The death of bees is at least that dramatic and with even more far-reaching consequences."" More Than Honey, the book based on the award-winning documentary of the same name, takes us on a global tour of the world of bees, introducing us along the way to ""killer bees,"" Frankenbees, beekeepers, and human pollinators. Markus Imhoof and Claus-Peter Lieckfeld examine both the history and current status of our relationship to and reliance on bees, and expose the human behaviors that are contributing to the decline of the bee population--a decline that could ultimately contribute directly to a world food problem. The authors intersperse information about the intricate social structure of the bee world and the problems faced by bees--ranging from the ubiquitous Varroa destructor to overuse of pesticides and an ever-shrinking natural landscape--with conversations and interviews with beekeepers and bee experts from across the world, balancing the views of those who see bees as simply a valuable source of income with the views of those who see bees as undervalued, misunderstood creatures that need our help to survive. The end result is a fascinating, accessible overview of a species that is crucial to our survival.<br> <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"WinMACSpoofer  Be invisible Straight out of the kitchen Ladies and Gentlemen we bring you WinMACSpoofer. <br><br>You need to spoof your MAC address in order to protect your privacy. This is called identity masking. Why would you want to do this? Lets take wild stab in the dark, shall we:<br><br>On a Wi-Fi network connection a MAC address is not encrypted. Even the secure IEEE 802.11i-2004 encryption method does not prevent Wi-Fi networks from sending out MAC addresses. Hence, in order to avoid being tracked, the user might choose to spoof the device's MAC address. However, hackers use the same technique to maneuver around network permissions without revealing their identity. Some networks use MAC filtering in order to prevent unwanted access. Hackers can use MAC spoofing to get access to a particular network and do some damage. Hackers' MAC spoofing pushes the responsibility for any illegal activity onto authentic users. As a result, the real offender may go undetected by law enforcement.<br><br>You will get:<br>-Windows application for spoofing the MAC address and host name.<br>-Full Source Code<br>-Full Instructions (Noob friendly, very easy to follow)<br><br>Lets fuck. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"ContamiNation My Quest to Survive in a Toxic World An investigation into the dangers of the chemicals present in our daily lives, along with practical advice for reducing these toxins in our bodies and homes, from acclaimed journalist McKay Jenkins.<br> <br>A few years ago, journalism professor McKay Jenkins went in for a routine medical exam. What doctors found was not routine at all: a tumor, the size of a navel orange, was lurking in his abdomen. When Jenkins returned to the hospital to have the tumor removed, he was visited by a couple of researchers with clipboards. They had some questions for him. Odd questions. How much exposure had he had to toxic chemicals and other contaminants? Asbestos dust? Vinyl chlorine? Pesticides? A million questions, all about seemingly obscure chemicals. Jenkins, an exercise nut and an enviro-conscious, organic-garden kind of guy, suddenly realized hed spent his life marinating in toxic stuff, from his wall-to-wall carpeting, to his dryer sheets, to his drinking water. And from the moment he left the hospital, he resolved to discover the truth about chemicals and the healthy levels of exposure we encounter each day as Americans.<br> <br>Jenkins spent the next two years digging, exploring five frontiers of toxic exposurethe body, the home, the drinking water, the lawn, and the local box storeand asking how we allowed ourselves to get to this point. He soon learned that the giants of the chemical industry operate virtually unchecked, and a parent has almost no way of finding out what the toy her child is putting in his or her mouth is made of. Most important, though, Jenkins wanted to know what we can do to turn things around. Though toxins may be present in products we all use every dayfrom ant spray, perfume, and grass seed to shower curtains and, yes, baby shampoothere are ways to lessen our exposure. ContamiNation is an eye-opening report from the front lines of consumer advocacy.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"The Race for What's Left The Global Scramble for t From Michael Klare, the renowned expert on natural resource issues, an invaluable account of a new and dangerous global competition<br><br>The world is facing an unprecedented crisis of resource depletiona crisis that goes beyond peak oil to encompass shortages of coal and uranium, copper and lithium, water and arable land. With all of the planets easily accessible resource deposits rapidly approaching exhaustion, the desperate hunt for supplies has become a frenzy of extreme exploration, as governments and corporations rush to stake their claim in areas previously considered too dangerous and remote. The Race for Whats Left takes us from the Arctic to war zones to deep ocean floors, from a Russian submarine planting the countrys flag on the North Pole seabed to the large-scale buying up of African farmland by Saudi Arabia, China, and other food-importing nations.<br><br>As Klare explains, this invasion of the final frontiers carries grave consequences. With resource extraction growing more complex, the environmental risks are becoming increasingly severe; the Deepwater Horizon disaster is only a preview of the dangers to come. At the same time, the intense search for dwindling supplies is igniting new border disputes, raising the likelihood of military confrontation. Inevitably, if the scouring of the globe continues on its present path, many key resources that modern industry relies upon will disappear completely. The only way out, Klare argues, is to alter our consumption patterns altogethera crucial task that will be the greatest challenge of the coming century.<br><br>Format: EPUB <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Obfuscation A User's Guide for Privacy and Protest With Obfuscation, Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum mean to start a revolution. They are calling us not to the barricades but to our computers, offering us ways to fight today's pervasive digital surveillance -- the collection of our data by governments, corporations, advertisers, and hackers. To the toolkit of privacy protecting techniques and projects, they propose adding obfuscation: the deliberate use of ambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with surveillance and data collection projects. Brunton and Nissenbaum provide tools and a rationale for evasion, noncompliance, refusal, even sabotage -- especially for average users, those of us not in a position to opt out or exert control over data about ourselves. Obfuscation will teach users to push back, software developers to keep their user data safe, and policy makers to gather data without misusing it.<br><br>Brunton and Nissenbaum present a guide to the forms and formats that obfuscation has taken and explain how to craft its implementation to suit the goal and the adversary. They describe a series of historical and contemporary examples, including radar chaff deployed by World War II pilots, Twitter bots that hobbled the social media strategy of popular protest movements, and software that can camouflage users' search queries and stymie online advertising. They go on to consider obfuscation in more general terms, discussing why obfuscation is necessary, whether it is justified, how it works, and how it can be integrated with other privacy practices and technologies.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Confessions of a Bangkok Private Eye Two-timing bargirls, suspicious spouses and lesbian lovers - it was all in a day's work for Bangkok Private Eye Warren Olson. For more than a decade, Olson walked the mean streets of the Big Mango. Fluent in Thai and Khmer, he was able to go where other private eyes feared to tread. His clients included Westerners who had lost their hearts and life savings to moneyhungry bargirls. But he had more than his fair share of Thai clients, too, including a sweet old lady who was ripped off by a Christian conman and a Thai girl blackmailed by a former lover. The stories are based on Olson's case files, disguised to protect the innocent and the guilty by bestselling author Stephen Leather. Olson has now relocated to his native New Zealand with his Thai wife and daughter, but the agency that he founded is still open for business. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"Irresistible APIs 2016 A Web API is a platform with a web-style interface developers can use to implement functionality. Well-designed APIs feel like a natural extension of the application, rather than just a new interface into the backend database. Designing Web APIs based on use cases allows an organization to develop irresistible APIs, which developers can consume easily and which support the business values of that organization.<br><br>Irresistible APIs provides step-by-step, jargon-free guidance for designing APIs that reflect an application's core business value, delight the developers who use them, and will stand the test of time. In it, business product managers and developers learn to treat an API as a first class product, discovering what questions to ask during design so that the first version is the best possible product. Because APIs are a combination of business needs and technical implementations, exercises throughout the book present both sides of the design process, allowing users to engage with the material that's most comfortable and relevant for them. After reading, teams will be able to design APIs that attract developers, lead their industry, and add value to their core business.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

But their rise brings with it a number of important questions for economics, politics, and democracy, questions taken up by a roster of stellar contributors in BRICS: An Anti-Capitalist Critique.<br> <br>Offering critical analyses of the rise of the BRICS economies within the framework of a predatory, exclusionary, and unequal global capitalism, the contributors tackle questions such as: Will the BRICS force social change and innovation on the established economic and political order? Do they herald a new opening for democracy and human rights, or are they likely to be forces of political repression? What should we expect in the coming years, especially as some of these economies face significant hurdles in the wake of the global financial crisis? A contrarian, anti-capitalist exploration of some of the most important national economies in the world today, BRICS offers a much-needed counterpoint to mainstream analysis.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"

"I-Doser - Complete Doses Digital download sent via PM<br><br>I-Doser is a program designed to give users ""binaural beat doses"" to ""sync their brainwaves."" It's a music-only media player that takes only DRG files. We'll let users speculate as to the meaning of DRG. These doses, according to the theory, are to align your mood with the theme of the dose. The two included doses, ""Alcohol"" and ""Content,"" have a not-so-subtle intended effect.<br><br>As far as the player goes, no media files besides DRG will work with it, and aside from the two freebies included, users must purchase any additional DRGs. Links are included to the I-Doser community to simplify sharing your I-Doser experiences. Powered by the freeware SbaGen, all in all this is a simple and limited program of mediocre use and questionable intent. It does, however, come with three snazzy skins and is worth downloading for the novelty if nothing else. <br>","D3DreamMarket","NO"
